    Given the assumptions noted so far, the answer to the <a href="./2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">previously
        noted question</a> - we should integrate when we are comfortable at the "No threat of violence" level.
</p>
<p>
    Going any further than that would certainly spell doom to our aspirations of longevity and independence - there
    simply aren't guarantees for a small (relatively underdeveloped) race unless you are fully integrated with a much
    more capable (group of) race(s)/planet(s) that can provide a guarantee of No Violence on a regional or even a
    galactic level. And we probably can't afford to wait much past 500-1000 years (no matter how well we manage the
    balance of societal and technological progress and develop defense-industrial capabilities) - simply because our
    system happens to have highly thought-after resources of Venus (and probably Mars). Resources that might be in
    extremely high demand by others who are not as lucky as ourselves (due to their cosmic neighborhood or other more
    controllable but overwhelming factors).
</p>
<p>
    Integrating at a lower profit-driven level would certainly doom us to loss of resources and exploitation, which with
    time would force our integration at a higher level and loss of independence (and possibly identity).
</p>
<p>
    Integrating at the level of "Open threat of Violence" would leave us in a confrontation with the peer (in terms of
    development) races/planets a la Star Trek, in a very high-risk setting. Nobody would be willing to take such large
    risks if there were better options available.
</p>
<p>
    Integrating at lower levels would be a nightmare that (probably) won't be allowed by the greater forces present (and
    certainly wouldn't be in our interests).
</p>
<p>
    If the assumptions about the presence of intelligent life in our Solar System and the eventual (500-1000 years in
    the future) alliance building at a more even level than we <a
        href="https://youtu.be/Uw5OLnN7UvM?si=L2Pfpn3dKEbPr-08">might be otherwise forced to</a> are correct then we
    would enter the Integration phase in a state very beneficial to ourselves (and likely to the greater forces on many
    sides) with much potential to help ourselves and help build a better neighborhood and eventually perhaps a better
    galaxy.
