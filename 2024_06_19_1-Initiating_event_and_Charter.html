<h1>Initiating event and Charter</h1>
1. Another good milestone for OF initialization is the event of <a
    href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroids-motion-in-space/">the
    first</a> industrial asteroid orbit adjustment that is sufficiently large.
<br>
<br>
Ideally (to ensure the safest possible course) the events of confirming life on Europa and the movement of a
fitting asteroid (likely both under influence of a single government entity) would (roughly) coincide.
<br>
<br>
In the case of separation of the two events, it makes sense for the asteroid orbit adjustment to take precedence as the
initiating event.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. To ensure maximum flexibility the OF charter should be written in language that leaves flexibility for inclusion of
all planets and all interested parties. Something like:
<br>
<br>
"OF is being created to ensure prevention of kinetic impacts and all other serious threats in the Solar System. All 
parties with planetary or Solar System defense capabilities are obligated to participate.
<br>
<br>
The necessary founding members of OF are the parties capable of establishing and playing a leading role in maintaining
orbital security. These are presently USA, RF, and PRN. All other parties with approaching capabilities such as EU, UK
(in not in with AUKUS) India, Israel and Iran (blocked together where appropriate) are obligated to participate as
candidates."
