It's 2024 and all I'm reading are news articles to understand the causes and dynamics of the ongoing conflicts. But I'm
still thinking about space so here are my notes. Once I get the time to read, they will aid in future articles (49 years
from now :).

While the information presented here may have been written down by a particular person it originates from a
multitude of sources and a result of work of untold number groups and individuals. The core contribution of the writer
is the attitude of importance of life above all (the adherence to the AWU principles) and the respect for time and age,
no matter what the geographical or galagraphical source of the life and age may be (with all other concerns considered
only if the above-specified ones are accommodated). I am grateful to the entire multitude of sources (natural and
supernatural) from which the ideas come and for the systematic protection and support I have received while logically
deriving the conclusions presented in these notes.
<br>
<br>
The evidence used to compile these notes, and the logic applied to that evidence are both limited by the
understanding available to the writer at the general time of composition and may contain (fundamental or lesser
level) flaws. Improvements are <a href="https://github.com/artem-v-shamsutdinov/notes/fork">welcomed</a>.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately I'm just another guy who is interested in peace, space and the future. To compile a better representation of
what the actual state of things is and the best course of action may be, many by more ideas are needed, over longer
periods of time, from other perspectives, provided they adhere to <a

    I thank God that we were alive, whole, undamaged, healthy, live long and happily. I pray to God for those whom I ought
    to pray for, have the right to pray for, must pray for simply that we were alive, whole and undamaged. And I know
    that it depends on us whether we will be alive, whole, undamaged, healthy, whether we will live long and happily.
