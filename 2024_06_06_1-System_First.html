<h1>System First</h1>

By 2032 the initial results of the Europa Clipper scans will be available and widely known. Given that the assumptions
made in the previous 5 articles are correct we are likely to find life there. The life that appeared and evolved
completely independently of life on Earth. And given that Europa is probably just as old as Earth it will likely be
advanced life, possibly with the presence of intelligent species (as I've briefly proposed in "It Ain't the Crown").
This will undoubtedly change our perception of the Universe and will be a pivotal moment in the development of our
civilization. Finding separately appearing life logically dictates that life is present wherever possible in the
Universe and thus also in our own Galaxy and its nearby region. Much will depend on the choices we'll make soon after
that discovery.
<br>
<br>
The argument I've made before is that we should continue to develop independently for as long as is acceptable to all
parties since that will maximize our potential for our own good and the good of our Galactic neighborhood. Good
children make everyone better. To accomplish this the general approach can be summed up in 2 (3) words:
<br>
<br>
<b>(Solar) System First</b>
<br>
<br>
This means we need to secure our System before we attempt any large-scale interactions outside of it. Given that we
have two other potentially habitable dry surface planets that period probably won't last long (500 to 1000 years) so
we'll need to maximize what we can accomplish in that time.
The next key assumption I'm making is that we have a multitude of intelligent species living on at least some of our 8
planets with sub-surface water. What comes to my mind is placing it at 3 planets with species in roughly the tribal
stage of development and one with industrial (not like ours likely) capacity. I don't know what 3 planets it would be
that would have the early stage societies but, based on what I saw in the live fly-by closeup of the New Horizons
mission and on what I saw in our Nature and Science museum two days ago (an interactive 3D model of the planet's
surface) it is Pluto that has advanced aquatic species.
<br>
<br>
Thus a moral dilemma immediately arises - if there are species capable of intelligent thought and technological
progress, they must be given the ability to become space-faring. Hence we must populate them in controlled areas on our
planet, allow them to see God's light and develop technology for space travel.
It is the right thing to do and doing so will be just as good for us as it would be for them. To put it another way, if
we don't do it we are asking for (some level) of trouble. This is where the brave guess of "diversants" comes in. It
could be an incentive to get us to do the right thing, after all: "If they don't do it they are wasting precious real
estate and may not deserve all of the deuterium it contains".
<br>
<br>
If that logic stands (as I continue to believe - man I just can't find anybody to talk to about this to check my
assumptions and am limited to monologues) then the more effectively we accomplish the goal of "Show the Light" the more
time we will be allowed to "See the Light" and develop our industrial and defense capacities. After all, we would be in
charge of defending (mostly from unfair trading practices but possibly also from comparatively small-scale pirate
attacks or something more serious caused by hardship) several other species as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>Update: 6/21/24</b>
The "a la Starship Troopers" envision of a species being able to gravitationally adjust orbits of (to become)
Earth-bound asteroids has visited my mind several times, but the probability of a significant physical impact along with
the ability to determine the correct orbital placements are most likely astronomically small. But, we should have plans
in place in case of a disastrous impact to prevent certain interest groups from spreading disinformation among the
public to attain influence for their own gain and cause hostilities between our species. Placing an asteroid on an
Earth-bound orbit would however be easily doable by ourselves if we fail to secure the movement of asteroids. Full,
multi-tier, and redundant (and multi-party) guarantees the security of asteroid movement must be of utmost importance.
<br>
<br>
Thus, we must prepare for the moment of the initial release of data from Europa Clipper and have a scenario in place
that will optimize our chances of long-term independence (and potentially survival as a distinct species), while
fulfilling optimal expectations of us.
The basic premise is that we need an organization to become the spine around which all subsequent space (and an
increasingly larger portion of surface economic and defense)activities will be organized. And the optimal time to set
up such a structure (I argue) would be immediately following the announcement of life on Europa. This is the structure
I'm calling (Solar) Orbital Fleet. The premise is simple - safety first.
<br>
<br>
This organization would accomplish several goals, and have 3 major branches:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Oceans:</b> study & secure (by then we'll collectively realize the resource potential and will begin to
        realize the real-estate potential)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Orbits:</b> secure (asteroid mining will be 8 years closer and our two main commercial projects of rocket
        development should have demonstrated sufficient capacity to accomplish it - an off-course asteroid could wipe
        out any city on the planet)

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Beyond:</b> study (this will have to be a closed structure, as I'm sure everybody understands <a href="https://youtu.be/wL9wvdbk7A4?si=7e5pjaeLvqXGcXux">the
        implications of premature integration</a>)
    </li>
</ol>
