We don't know for certain but the following speculation should probably be on the "General Staff" planning boards (no
later than us being bold enough to make extraplanetary claims):
<br>
<br>
With the assumptions of a <a href="https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/I_never_met.html#complex_galagraphy">complex balance of forces</a> and
existing <a href="https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/Coming_in_on_a_Wing_and_a_Prayer.html#moving_planets">planet moving/terraforming
    capabilities</a> in our galactic neighborhood, Venus and Mars may be already considered (and possibly have been <a
    href="https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#solar_system_creation_hypothesis">since the creation of the solar system</a>)
potential alliance-building planets that (if correctly utilized in a more distant future, <a
    href="https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#population_of_Venus">probably past 500-1000 years</a>) will benefit the entire
region and possibly beyond.
<br>
<br>
We should keep this in mind as we consider the possibility of allowing expansionist tendencies. We should also keep in
mind that having more than one home planet is likely a bad idea as both become disposable and would possibly position us
as an aggressive expansionist species (to be dealt with accordingly).
