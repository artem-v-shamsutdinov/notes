    Once the Orbital Fleet becomes a reality (or perhaps even before, to make it a reality) there will be a number of
    fundamental factors that will allow for its creation and successful operation. These are fundamental, active
    realizations that people will have to proactively be making for as long as there are major divisions between us on
    Earth. The first 3 are the same as they are with NLNM but extend a bit further, and 2 more identified factors are
    added on top:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://past-the-war.earth/notes/Number_One_Factor_to_NLNM.html">Seeing human</a> in counterparts from
        other countries and (Sub-)Continents. The emphasis needs to be placed on the human characteristics that make us
        continuously strive towards common good. One such characteristic is conscience. As cross-cultural and
        cross-civilizational conflicts come up the recognition of this and other positive characteristics will go a long
        way towards building a basis for (in case of Orbital Fleet) joint functioning. Eventually focusing on
        characteristics instead of on belonging to humans of Earth will allow for Orbital Fleet to operate in the
        future, no matter how externally different our future counterparts will be.</li>
    <li><a href="https://past-the-war.earth/notes/Number_Two_Factor-Mother_Planet_Earth.html">Recognizing that our
            shared planetary realities</a> and needs will clearly identify priorities of Orbital Fleet that go beyond
        the needs of a country, nation or (sub-)continent. Beyond that, recognizing the realities of orbiting our Sun
        will provide an alike basis for aligning priorities. The same principle can eventually be applied beyond to
        wider neighborhoods. We all love our planet though the recognition of this is often hidden by cultural and
        geographic divisions we naturally live with. And eventually we'll recognize our love for our star and at some
        point (at least as we put in the work) our galactic neighborhood.</li>
    <li><a href="https://past-the-war.earth/notes/Number_Three_Factor-All_Culture_is_Work.html">Respect the time and
            work put into other cultures</a></li>
    <li><u>Common purpose</u>: Orbital Fleet will consist of individuals from various countries, nations on various
        (sub-)continents. What will unite them is the work they are doing for a common purpose. Continuous, active
        realization of this may be necessary (at least to begin with) and may be helpful in any age and any level of
        inclusion into the organization.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><u>Respect time and mind your own</u>: We all make mistakes. Different mistakes and in different ways. These are
        often better seen from a distance. Failure to fix those mistakes in a timely manner may unsettle or even offend.
        Nonetheless, there are and will be other mechanisms (including NLNM) for helping other countries, nations and
        (sub-)continents to fix mistakes of any level of gravity (if by no other way than by proving who's right before
        God and people). Orbital Fleet must focus on its common purpose, no matter what part of the world (and
        eventually beyond) its various members are from.</li>
