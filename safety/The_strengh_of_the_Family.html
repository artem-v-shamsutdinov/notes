<b>Updated 7/7/2024</b>
<br>
<br>
In the scenario of <a href="../2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">existing aquatic races</a> in (probably several of) our
ocean planets, their population in Earth's oceans solves several problems:
<br>
<br>
Firstly it places humanity in the position of an older sibling who is taking on the responsibility of (eventually)
guiding races to developing space-faring technology. This is important under the assumption (which
itself is based on the universal existence of life and the universe having been capable of supporting life for several
billions of years) that (likely) several races in our galaxy guide (on various levels) less developed races to the (as
safe as possible) cosmic integration. This also assumes that (as the early 2023 near-solar show of force demonstrated)
we are under the protectorate (and possibly systemic guidance) of the far more technologically (and likely socially)
advanced races.
<br>
<br>
<b>Updated 7/8/2024</b>
<br>
<i>
    The recent near-solar show of force appeared to be of a patrolling nature (possibly a change of the sentinel). Given
    our presence and our defenseless (in terms of the external world, short of improperly attained and relatively
    insignificant 8+43) state, it only makes sense that the sentinel is here for our sake. Of course, there are other
    scenarios like the need to secure a frontier or simply protecting a fuel source (assuming, as confirmed by earlier
    and arguable sentinel corona entry evidence, as well as the arguable "Jupiter" vortex evidence). These scenarios
    could be correct and there could be many other scenarios. Still, the scenario that is the most morally correct one
    and thus (given the assumed <a href="../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">more advanced social state</a> of a
    technologically superior society) is assumed to be the preponderating one.
    <br>
    <br>
    Given the <a href="../thoughts_of_the_future//the_three_planets/The_refugees_and_the_Sun.html#parable">fuel for
        space scenario</a>, and the assumed complexity of the region (borough, or possibly the entire galaxy - city) and
    the assumed diversity of interests (given our own continued and relatively untouched existence) we are likely under
    a much more extensive coalition protectorate. Yet the presence of a sentinel appears to be necessary. This leads to
    an assumption that the inter-stellar neighborhood we are in is not very safe (at least for nascent races). Given the
    relatively significant size of the sentinel, the threat (of at least a significant level of interference) is
    non-trivial.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Thus, with us taking on the role of an "older sibling" we are showing responsibility and are greatly improving our own
chances of being a far-going, independent race. This of course would raise expectations of our usefulness in
conflict-reducing deal-making (and potentially peace-making), helping solve the (likely) persistent presence of
large-scale violence (again demonstrated by the recent show of force). We don't know what level of agreement our region
(or the entire galaxy) has achieved and how coordinated the attacks and responses are (especially on stagnant or less
developed races) but lethal, mutilating or seriously injuring conflict appears to be present, which means there are
casualties. There is always a better way and all involved parties would benefit from more <a
    href="../2024_06_14_1-Alive_Whole_and_Undamaged.html">AWU</a>.
<br>
<br>
In the (relative, in terms of the "parent" races) short term (of several thousand years) a decision to take the route of
an "older sibling" would certainly put a strain on our society and economy. However, this will also accelerate our
ability to make safe (and eventually secure) our Solar System and (more importantly) accelerate our social progress (by
placing us into the position of caretakers). Ultimately this will benefit the survival of life on Earth as an ecosystem
and will lead us to the successful path of maintaining (and <a
    href="../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#managing_the_Sun">eventually managing</a>) our star (making us truly
independent, before being able to help on a regional and eventually galactic level).
<br>
<br>
Again, with the assumption of the existence of aquatic races in our ocean planets, this would of course benefit the
migrating portion of the aquatics, giving them a fresh start and a positive long-term outlook for their own future. And
of course, being more closely tied to the oceans, they would most likely do a much better job of preserving them and
ensuring their long-term health and vitality (as is probably widely known by the interested externals, from previous
examples). <b>Updated - same day</b> Having (an)other vested persective(s) on proper balance (likely between <a
    href="../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">stages 4 and 5</a>) in the extend and velocity of deuterium
utilization will also be greatly beneficial. It is far more likely that <a
    href="../2024_06_14_4-No_threat_of_violence.html">stage 5 should preponderate</a> - our expedited industrial
progress is likely of much less concern to all involved parties than our (and with the above assumptions Solar) societal
experiment and its longer-term implications for the region and possibly the galaxy as a whole.
<br>
<br>
We will have plenty of time to become big and strong but we'll be stronger if we stand (or just inadvertently help
others stand) united (at least on the most important issues) - locally and probably (for others) regionally (or even
galactically). This applies internally to ourselves as a race and (with the assumption of the existence of intelligent
aquatic species in our Solar System) as the natives of a given star.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, together (both as a species and as the assumed Solar natives) we'll do best by demonstrating (at the most
optimal pace, to ourselves and others) the peaceful and synergetic coexistence of the various groupings of the human
race (and, as assumed, the native Solar species, safely separated by the nature of the habitats and eventually probably
by the set oceanic boundaries). If this scenario proves to be true, only the future can tell what additional benefits
such a coexistence would lead to. We have some time before the Solar System realities become crystal clear, let's
continue to spend thought and effort on improving our already evident certainties in the <a
    href="https://past-the-war.earth">way</a>s we can.
