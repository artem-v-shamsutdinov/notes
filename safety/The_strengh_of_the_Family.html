<h1>The strengh of the Family</h1>
In the scenario of <a href="../2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">existing aquatic races</a> in (probably several) of our
ocean planets, their population in Earth's oceans solves several problems.
<br>
<br>
Firstly it places humanity in the position of an older sibling who is taking on the responsibility of (eventually)
guiding races to the position of developing technology for space-faring. This is important under the assumption (which
itself is based on the universal existence of life and the universe having been capable of supporting life for several
billions of years) that (likely) several races in our galaxy guide (on various levels) less developed races to the (as
safe as possible) cosmic integration. This also assumes that (as the early 2023 near-solar show of force demonstrated)
we are under the protectorate (and possibly systemic guidance) of the far more technologically (and likely socially)
advanced races.
<br>
<br>
Thus, with us taking on the role of "an older sibling" we are showing responsibility and are greatly improving our own
chances of being a far-going, independent race. This of course would raise expectations of our usefulness in
conflict-reducing deal-making (and potentially peace-making), helping solve the (likely) persistent presence of
large-scale violence (again demonstrated by the recent show of force). We don't know what level of agreement our region
(or the entire galaxy has achieved) and how coordinated the attacks and responses are (especially on stagnant or less
developed races) but lethal and maiming conflict appears to be present, which means there are casualties. There is
always a better way and all involved parties would benefit from more <a

<br>
<br>
In the (relative, in terms of the "parent" races) short term (of several thousand years) a decision to take the route of
an "older sibling" would certainly put a strain on our society and economy. However, this will also accelerate our
ability to make safe (and eventually secure) our Solar System and (more importantly) accelerate our social progress (by
placing us into the position of caretakers). Ultimately this will benefit the survival of life on Earth as an ecosystem
and will lead us to the successful path of maintaining (and <a
    href="../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#managing_the_Sun">eventually managing</a>) our star (making us truly
independent, before being able to help on a regional and eventually galactic level).
<br>
<br>
Again, with the assumption of the existence of aquatic races in our ocean planets, this would of course benefit the
migrating portion of the aquatics, giving them a fresh start and a positive long-term outlook for their own future. And
of course, being more closely tied to the oceans, they would most likely do a much better job of preserving them and
ensuring their long-term health and vitality (as is probably widely known by the interested externals, from previous
examples).
<br>
<br>
Ultimately together we would demonstrate (to ourselves and others) the (likely not very common scenario of) peaceful
(and even synergetic) coexistence of multiple species (safely separated by the nature of the habitats). If this scenario
proves to be true, only the future can tell what additional benefits such a coexistence would lead to.
