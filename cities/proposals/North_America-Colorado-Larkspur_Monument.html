<h1>
    North-America - Colorado - between Larkspur & Monument
</h1>
<p>
    Based on the idea for <a href="../Beauty_will_save_the_World.html">new cities</a> dedicated to the Orbital Fleet
    operational centers.
</p>
<p>
    As a 30-year resident of Colorado, I am personally motivated to make the following proposal for a new city dedicated
    to the North American operational center of the Orbital Fleet:
</p>
<p>
    Location: North (and a bit east?) of Monument, Colorado.
</p>
<h2>1. Survivability</h2>
<p>
    Placed at an elevation of 2 kilometers this location is well safe from any coastal kinetic attacks (asteroid impacts
    into oceans, angled to temporarily cover large areas of a continent with massive volumes of water) or long-term,
    large area (lower-)atmospheric attacks. There are no apparent international security risks.
</p>
<h2>
    2. Territory
</h2>
<p>
    This is a beautiful spot with several small mountains and butts that could be used for building impressing
    terrain features into the heart of the city. Situated at the front range of the Rocky Mountains it offers a
    tied-to-nature location.
</p>
<h2>3. Spiritual & Historical Significance</h2>
<p>
    Facing the vast expanse of open prairie to the East and the Rocky Mountain wilderness to the West this location
    naturally points to the Native American beginnings of humanity in North America and invites the freedom of
    possibilities. Themed appropriately it would pay homage to our common tribal beginnings.
</p>
<h2>4. Economics</h2>
<p>
    Located between Denver and Colorado Springs the city would promote economic growth for the
    entire Front Range region. It would incentivize the development of related businesses in Colorado Springs,
    revitalizing the city. It would also incentivize mass transit development from Denver and Colorado Springs.
</p>
<h2>5. Society</h2>
<p>
    Placing a beautiful humanism-oriented space center in this area would greatly advance the cowboy-like Colorado
    culture while keeping its love of nature. It will improve the locally common <a
        href="../../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">"Open + Veiled Threat of Violence"</a> culture by adding the
    "No Threat of Violence" and discipline-oriented cultural core, re-inventing the region's frontier mentality and
    contributing to its cultural development. It would gradually build a new (geographically central) center in North
    America and ensure its cultural prominence while accepting its tribal and frontier roots.
