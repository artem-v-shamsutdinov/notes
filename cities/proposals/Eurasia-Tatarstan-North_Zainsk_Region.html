DRAFT 1:

<h1>Eurasia - Tatarstan - North Zainsk Region</h1>
<p>
    Based on the idea for new cities dedicated to the Orbital Fleet operational centers.
</p>
<p>
    Having been born and raised in Nizhnekamsk, I am personally motivated to make the following proposal for a new city
    dedicated to the Eurasian operational center of the Orbital Fleet:
</p>
<p>
    Location: South of Elabuga, (south) west of Naberezhnye Chelny, north of Zainsk, and (south) east of Nizhnekamsk.
    Possibly directly north of Akhmet'evo?
</p>
<h2>1. Survivability</h2>
<p>
    Placed well in from the Arctic Ocean (the only nearby body of water sufficiently big for a deep coastal kinetic
    attack). Over 300 kilometers west of Urals it is safely away from any possible East Asian contention (in the
    unlikely case of Siberia takeover). It is also sufficiently distant from EU borders, the Middle East, and South Asia
    (with the assumption of Eurasian-friendly (or at least buffering) Central Asia.
</p>
<h2>2. Territory</h2>
<p>
    Situated between the (multi-lingually) symbolically named Kama and Zai rivers this location offers plenty of
    beautiful hilly areas to build into natural city-scapes.
</p>
<h2>
    3. Spiritual & Historical Significance
</h2>
<p>
    Located in the peacefully mixed Christian (Russian) - Muslim (Tatar) region (yet sufficiently distant from the Tatar
    cultural and regional capital of Kazan) this region symbolizes the multi-ethnic and multi-religious nature of
    Eurasia. The Tatar language belongs to the Turkic group of languages which ties in most Central Asian nationalities
    and several European and Siberian nationalities. The nearby city of Elabuga is (at the time of writing) nearly 1000
    years old, and the slightly more closely located Naberezhnye Chelny is over 850 years old.
</p>
<h2>4. Economics</h2>
<p>
    Placing the Eurasian Orbital Fleet operational center in this location would almost immediately create an over 1
    million people strong urban agglomeration (which is significant for Eurasia). Its central placement between Kazan,
    Perm, Ufa, Orenburg, Samara, and Ul'yanovsk would create a centrally located Eurasian economic center. With the
    adoption of nuclear fusion, the city will employment for the population of Nizhnekamsk, currently heavily relying on
    the processing of petrochemicals.
</p>
<h2>
    5. Society
</h2>
<p>
    Creating a (combined, non-nationality-focused) Eurasian cultural center at this location will strengthen the
    cross-cultural friendship of the Russian and the Volga-Kama river basin nationalities. It will also create a
    representation of the Siberian and Central Asian nationalities in the European part of Eurasia. This cultural
    center would create a physical manifestation of the shared Eurasian identity.
