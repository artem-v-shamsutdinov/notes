<h1>Beauty will save the World</h1>
<p>
    Beauty will save the world. This has been true at least since the times of <a
        href="../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">Total Violence</a> when women being beautiful
    (not attractive or God forbid sexy) greatly increased the chance of their survival and the survival of their
    children - our little world. This also translates to the survival of our entire planet. It is beauty (and our
    emotional connection to it) will ultimately be the reason that will prevent us (and others who observe it) from
    overexploiting or utterly destroying it. And eventually the same will translate to our Sun and beyond.
</p>
<p>
    But very few of us now live and work in direct contact with the wild nature. By far most of us live and work in
    increasingly larger cities. When the Orbital Fleet headquarters are established across the globe they will be
    established in cities. In cities that will already be large or will grow large with time.
</p>
<p>
    The only place that exists in the world that everyone on its surface wants to see and experience is inner <a
        href="../../2023/Paris_or_Bust.html">Paris</a>. The rest are not symmetrical enough, are not properly enough
    accented, or are generally not nearly as well planned.
</p>
<p>
    Thus it makes sense to build new cities. And there are plenty of other reasons to build them like the need for a
    safe distance from the kinetically threatened seas and separation from national (and thus not sufficiently
    holistically oriented) control centers. For (a la internet) redundancy reasons (as well as prevention of hegemon
    regions) at least one center must (eventually) exist per populated continent, and at least one must exist in (at
    least) our two oldest cultural sub-continents. The general proposal is to (within a century from the establishment
    of Orbital Fleet) have centers in (at least):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Africa</li>
    <li>South Asia</li>
    <li>East Asia</li>
    <li>Europe</li>
    <li>Eurasia</li>
    <li>North America</li>
    <li>South America</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It only makes sense to ensure that these cities are as beautiful as we can make them. There are a multitude of
    reasons why they must be beautiful (including safety concerns) but most importantly their beauty will help maintain
    the culture of Orbital Fleet as <a href="../2024_06_14_1-Alive_Whole_and_Undamaged.html">AWU</a> and taut for eons
    to come.
</p>
<p>
    These cities should be built in alignment with the longest-term common goals we are capable of envisioning at the
    time of their initial layout. There must never be a hint of a reason that would justify their (whole or partial,
    hostile) destruction based on a (direct or implied) justification of them conflicting with the new course of events.
