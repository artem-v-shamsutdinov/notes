    Beauty will save the world. This has been true at least since the times of <a
        href="../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html">Total Violence</a> when (non-combatant) women being beautiful
    (not attractive or God forbid sexy) greatly increased the chance of their survival and the survival of their
    children (in the case of a hostile takeover) - our little world. This also translates to the survival of our entire planet. It's beauty (and our
    emotional connection to it) will ultimately be the reason that will prevent us (and others who observe it) from
    overexploiting or utterly destroying it. And eventually the same will translate to our Sun and beyond.
</p>
<p>
    But very few of us now live and work in direct contact with the wild nature. By far most of us live and work in
    increasingly larger cities. When the Orbital Fleet headquarters are established across the globe they will be
    established in cities. In cities that will already be large or will grow large with time.
</p>
<p>
    The only place that exists in the world that everyone on its surface wants to see and experience is inner <a
        href="../../2023/Paris_or_Bust.html">Paris</a>. The rest are not symmetrical enough, are not properly enough
    accented, or are generally not nearly as well planned.
</p>
<p>
    Thus it makes sense to build new cities. And there are plenty of other reasons to build them like the need for a
    safe distance from the kinetically threatened seas and separation from national (and thus not sufficiently
    holistically oriented) control centers. For (a la internet) redundancy reasons (as well as prevention of hegemon
    regions) at least one center must (eventually) exist per populated continent, and at least one must exist in (at
    least) our two oldest cultural sub-continents. The general proposal is to (within a century from the establishment
    of Orbital Fleet) have centers in (at least):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Africa</li>
    <li>South Asia</li>
    <li>East Asia</li>
    <li>Europe</li>
    <li>Eurasia</li>
    <li>North America</li>
    <li>South America</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It only makes sense to ensure that these cities are as beautiful as we can make them. There are a multitude of
    reasons why they must be beautiful (including safety concerns) but most importantly their beauty will help maintain
    the culture of Orbital Fleet as <a href="../2024_06_14_1-Alive_Whole_and_Undamaged.html">AWU</a> and taut for eons
    to come.
</p>
<p>
    These cities should be built in alignment with the longest-term common goals we are capable of envisioning at the
    time of their initial layout. There must never be a hint of a reason that would justify their (whole or partial,
    hostile) destruction based on a (direct or implied) justification of them conflicting with the new course of events.
</p>
<b>Update 6/25/2024</b>
<h2>
    Culture - the hope of long term identity
</h2>
<p>
    Orbital Fleet operational center cities should be leaders in the culture of their macro-regions. If two cultures
    clash and one of them is less refined (and can be deemed as primitive) then the more refined culture has the high
    ground and can find justifications for encroaching on (and assimilating in) the less refined culture. Thus the
    Orbital Fleet (our first, future, interface with the greater Cosmic world) cities must maintain the highest possible
    cultural standards. This includes the maintenance of our roots in our multi-million year long evolutionary history and the
    continuous refinement of our time-tested (and within reason latest) high-cultural branches.
</p>
<p>
    Inner Paris (the default proposed seed location for Orbital Fleet) demonstrates this well. Containing dedicated
    places of culture and ideology (like religion) it brings up the general cultural level of its population. The same
    goes for all other cultural centers on the planet, which for that reason should (arguably) host secondary Orbital
    Fleet locations.
</p>
<p>
    While our evolutionary roots and humanity are common and there should be a common Orbital Fleet culture, the cities
    should maintain their regional cultural flavor. Just as genetic variation improves the survivability of a species
    cultural evolution improves survivability of identity. We do not know what cultural traits will eventually make us
    more competitive in the greater Cosmic world. Perhaps (and likely) we will need many (and probably all) of them to
    successfully interface with different external parties.
</p>
<p>
    Culture undoubtedly includes religion. Orbital Fleet cities should act as both preservation centers of our distinct
    religious heritages and as centers of agreement. The regions most prevalent in the respective macro-regions should
    certainly be more prominent in the corresponding cities. At the same time, communication between various religious
    groups and the ability to act in coordination should be facilitated.
</p>
<h2>
    Physical culture - the fitness of survival
</h2>
<p>
    Places of physical culture are integral parts of general cultural presence. While institutions associated with
    sports may not be appropriate in defense-focused cities, institutions associated with the maintenance and
    improvement of physical culture are essential. Emphasizing culture builds a cultivation of health and fitness for
    the (probably, among others) ultimate reason - secure longevity.
</p>
<h2>
    Family - the meaning of survival
</h2>
<p>
    Militaries have a long history of stationing warriors in distant but strategically important places. More recently
    the officer core has been able to have their families living with them. Going forward, as many personnel as
    possible need to have the opportunity to have their families near the stations. There are many benefits
    to maintaining a family-oriented culture, but at the very least this will boost morale and improve decision-making.
    Thus the cities need to have places of primary and secondary education and recreation.
</p>
<h2>
    Education - the science of survival
</h2>
<p>
    And certainly Orbital Fleet will need to have a culture of higher knowledge and wisdom, with appropriate
    installations and institutions placed in its cities.
