<i>There must be a reason for the beauty of our Earth and Solar System, beauty that will save the world.</i>

<br>
Some cosmologist whose ideas are also contributing to these writings.
<br>
<br>
<p>
    The MTABS model was not written as a result of careful logical analysis but was simply driven by the need for
    long-term survival. It is based on one key premise that drives all of its assumptions and logic - let's keep the
    Earth and the Sun going on forever (and then participate in helping to apply that concept to greater constructs).
    Since we are the main (known to us) interested party in this it naturally leads to the necessity of us developing
    independent (as in native to the Solar System) capabilities to accomplish that goal.
</p>
<p>
    This (again naturally) leads to the beginning phases of the MTABS model being what they are. They can also be
    logically explained in various ways. Here is one such way:
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Phases 1 - 5</b> - focus on Earth. MTABS model assumes the existence of aquatic intelligent species in our ocean
    planets. Logically they are the ones who are even more interested in keeping the Sun going even when humanity will
    have the ability to build interstellar habitats. Thus we have a common long-term goal. Going forward it will be up
    to us to maintain our naturally dominating position on the dry surface of the planet (with our own pre-history-based
    assumption of the inability of two intelligent species to co-exist there, at least not without full economic
    integration). Thus, integration into the larger inter-stellar world around us in <b>Clarified 2/9/2025</b> Phase 1
    or 2 would force us to full
    (or at least economic) regional (or possibly even galactic) integration and abandon both the control and the
    unquestioned drive for the long-term survival of the planet and the Solar System. So in these phases idea is to stay
    away from
    (at least open and acknowledged) external contact while we ensure that the Earth stays populated by the speciess
    that are most interested in its
    survival and the survival of the Sun which gives it the ability to host life (in a way that is naturally
    maintainable and prevents inter-species war).
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Phases 3 - 6</b> - focus on the Solar System. The MTABS model assumes a multitude of intelligent raises (of
    various degrees of development) in our stellar neighborhood. With this assumption, we will necessarily have to
    integrate into this wider world as a child species, that is at the very beginning of its developmental (in cosmic
    terms) process. The logical solution is to interest more parties in the solution of the MTABS problem. Thus,
    inviting external species with the greatest need (and relatively close to us developmentally) to populate Venus and
    Mars (with the initial blessing and help of forces capable of arranging these 3 planets in the habitable zone) is
    the
    logical solution.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Added: 2/9/2025</b> And with the assumption of existence of sub-surface species on Venus and Mars, an even more
    important factor will be the ability of these incoming species to coexist with the present sub-surface beings and
    help them achieve interstellar travel in their own right. The two-species on the surface of one planet problem is
    (presently) assumed to be solved by initial surface-to-subsurface separation of habitats and ever increasing usage
    of the Solar System resources by the incoming species, with the (at least specified and targeted) goal of leaving
    planetary resources for use by the native species (until they reach the stage of star-system resource usage in their
    own right).
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Added: 2/10/2025</b> Per the MTABS model, by Phase 3 Humanity is expected to enter into <a
        href="../timescale_progression/MTABS_Timescale_Progression.html#Phase-3">partial usage</a> of non-renewable,
    Solar-System based resources. At the same it is expected to have achieved <a
        href="../../2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html#Phase-3">No Inter-National</a> Threat of Violence (within
    Sub-Continents) and to <a href="../our_way/If_you_hurry_you_make_people_laugh.html#Phase-3">solve
        Inter-(Sub-)Continental conflicts</a> with NLNM combat and late/coordinated maneuvering engagements. This,
    combined with the logically expected No Threat of Violence <a
        href="../../2024_06_14_4-No_threat_of_violence.html">level of integration</a> and the proposed corresponding
    Orbital Fleet <a href="../../2024_06_19_1-Initiating_event_and_Charter.html">guidelines</a> should enable
    inter-planetary relations at No Threat of Violence; and agreed upon, shared and balanced usage of non-renewable
    resources in the Solar System (between the incoming space-faring species and ourselves). It then follows that
    Interplanetary (higher-level/purpose coordinated) NLNM combat and Solar System force positioning (such us
    patrolling, supply convoys and multi-purpose, externally aware force deployments) are assumed to be sufficient to
    provide a directed and controlled outlet for Solar System-internal inter-space-faring species aggression.
    <br>
    <br>
    This would form <b>Clarified: 2/9/2025</b> a cross planetary alliance of species that would keep each other going in
    accomplishing the MTABS goal, as well as help bring the region or possibly eventually the entire galaxy closer
    together, and result in a multitude of other long-term and wide-reaching benefits unlocked by such an approach.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Phases 5 - 7</b> - focus on the Sun and it's long term safety and survival (and the associated safety and
    survival of the Solar System and the Earth in it). <b>Added: 2/10/2025</b> Hypothesized controlled/non-agressive
    Solar core resource utilization as part of the associated preservation efforts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>Parallel (3+) & Subsequent Phases</b> - gradually integrate into the interstellar world. Continuously
    demonstrating our drive and ability to survive and help others thrive (in peace and eventual Solargraphic unity of
    interests) we (and eventually the local aquatics, <b>Added: 2/9/2025</b> and the assumed sub-surface species of
    Venus and Mars) would now be in a position to start (slowly, as cosmic child species) integrating into the wider
    world (first with constant oversight and subsequently and gradually more independently).
