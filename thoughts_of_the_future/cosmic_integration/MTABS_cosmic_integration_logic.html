<i>There must be reason for the beauty of our Earth and Solar System, beauty that will safe the world.</i>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    The MTABS model was not written as a result of careful logical analysis but was simply driven by the need for
    long-term survival. It is based on one key premise that drives all of its assumptions and logic - let's keep the
    Earth and the Sun going on forever (and then participate in helping to apply that concept to greater constructs).
    Since we are the main (known to us) interested party in this it naturally leads to the necessity of us developing
    independent (as in native to the Solar System) capabilities to accomplish that goal.
</p>
<p>
    This (again naturally) leads to the beginning phases of the MTABS model being what they are. They can also be
    logically explained in various ways. Here is one such way:
</p>
<p>
    <b>Phases 1 & 2</b> - focus on Earth. MTABS model assumes the existence of aquatic intelligent races in our ocean
    planets. Logically they are the ones who are even more interested in keeping the Sun going even when humanity will
    have the ability to build interstellar habitats. Thus we have a common long-term goal. Going forward it will be up
    to us to maintain our naturally dominating position on the dry surface of the planet (with our own pre-history-based
    assumption of the inability of two intelligent races to co-exist there, at least not without full economic
    integration). Thus, integration into the larger inter-stellar world around us at this point would force us to full
    (or at least economic) regional (or possibly even galactic) integration and abandon both the control and the
    unquestioned drive for the long-term survival of the planet and the Solar System. So the idea is to stay away from
    external contact while we ensure that the Earth stays populated by the races that are most interested in its
    survival and the survival of the Sun which gives it the ability to host life (in a way that is naturally
    maintainable
    and prevents inter-race war).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Phases 3 & 4</b> - focus on the Solar System. The MTABS model assumes a multitude of intelligent raises (of
    various degrees of development) in our stellar neighborhood. With this assumption, we will necessarily have to
    integrate into this wider world as a child race, that is at the very beginning of its developmental (in cosmic
    terms) process. The logical solution is to interest more parties in the solution of the MTABS problem. Thus,
    inviting external races with the greatest need (and relatively close to us developmentally) to populate Venus and
    Mars (with the initial blessing and help of races capable of arranging these 3 planets in the habitable zone) is the
    logical solution. This would form an alliance of races that would keep each other going in accomplishing the MTABS
    goal, as well as help bring the region or possibly eventually the entire galaxy closer together, and result in a
    multitude of other long-term and wide-reaching benefits unlocked by such an approach.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Subsequent Phases</b> - integrate into the interstellar world. Having demonstrated our drive and ability to
    survive and (mostly inadvertently) help others thrive (in peace or possible unity of interests, and in the case of
    the races present in the Solar System help survive) we (and eventually the local aquatics) would now be in a
    position to start (slowly, as a cosmic infant child race) integrating into the wider world (first with constant
    oversight and subsequently, gradually more independently).
