    What is the way forward for humanity? What defines us now and what will define us in the future? Here is a logical
    proposal of our possible development that stems out of the MTABS model:
</p>
<p>
    These question is largely for all of us to decide. Yes, with a very high degree of probability, we as a species are
    being safely guided through history. But, the long-term survival of the species is a minimal goal for us. We can
    accomplish so much and help the greater community (which MTABS assumes exists) accomplish much more.
</p>
<h2>Oceans</h2>
<p>
    There are however factors that are fixed and are not easily changeable (certainly not by us and not for a while).
    Our continents are arranged in a certain way that (to the best of our understanding) places us in a long period of
    ice ages and warm-up periods and we are at the warmest part of the current one. Thus, once we solve the current
    atmospheric issues and (likely) subsequently learn to control volcanic activity (maybe tap the then rising magma of
    Yellow Stone for massive construction projects), we will have to take control of the water flows in the oceans to
    ensure our continuous population of the majority of the dry surface of the planet.
</p>
<p>
    The presumed ?4? intelligent aquatic species that MTABS model assumes exist in our ocean planets/moons (naturally in
    various stages of societal and industrial development) will (presumably) have to be populated in different parts of
    our larger water bodies. The initial experiment (Phases 1 & 2 of 500 to 1000 years) would populate a (presumably)
    lesser-developed race (a task that will be within our technological capabilities to accomplish and within the
    tolerances that the global society will accept) in a place that fits the need best (presumably the Indian Ocean,
    given the presence of the most time-proven civilization, capable of guiding and tolerating the immigrants. Sometime
    within this time (depending on the success of the project) our capabilities will grow, the benefits of the symbiotic
    existence will become apparent and we will be introducing populations into other regions. The assumption is that the
    (likely by far) most advanced of the aquatic species would be populated in a region that is both vast enough for
    them and can be secured by the multitude of our most capable (and unified) forces as well as separated geography
    (presumably the Pacific Ocean). Likely this will be the time when we will be developing the capability to control
    the flow of the oceans (and along with it the capability to control the spread of the aquatics and limit the
    naturally occurring conflicts between them). At the same time, we will also be placing the remaining (possibly least
    developed and potentially dangerous on a natural level) species into other localities that can be secured (the South
    China Sea with the excellent capabilities of Philippine and Vietnamese cultures appear to be a candidate place,
    giving these cultures additional sources of redistributed resources and additional significance; the Celebes Sea or
    the lower lying seans look like other good geographically buffering candidates).
</p>
<h2>Planets</h2>
<p>
    The next big factor that MTABS takes into account is the presence of Venus and Mars in our inner Solar System. The
    MTABS approach (which assumes the existence of numerous extra-Solar civilizations of varying degrees of development)
    is not to attempt to colonize them but to make the inner Solar System an exemplary place of peaceful
    co-habitation and symbiotic co-existence (that would have far-reaching unifying effects for our galactic region and
    possibly beyond). Naturally, these would have to be other babies (though not necessarily as little as us) that are
    in dire need (and are possibly cared for by other caretakers). If (or in MTABS style - when) we decide to take the
    path of alliance-building we would have to carefully choose the candidate races for population on our planets. It
    will be very important for us to understand at that time that no matter what we think will benefit us and our
    benefactors best the first criterion will have to be the gravity of the need - the space should be allocated to the
    ones that MUST be helped. The MTABS model places these developments into Phase 3 & 4 (between 500 and 100,000 years
    from now) - which is (very likely) a rather short period of time for the ones that supply law and order in our
    region and for their peers.
</p>
<p>
    These developments appear to be even more scary than letting multiple intelligent species settle our oceans but we
    must look at things through the perspective of common benefit. Increased unity will greatly advance the capabilities
    of our region of the galaxy and (logically) eventually the combined capabilities of all of our regions. <b>Update

        unido jamás será vencido!"</a>
</p>
<h2>Star</h2>
<p>
    The next dominating factor is the type and age of our Sun. We are taught in schools that our Sun will blow up in a
    violent explosion that will destroy the inner Solar System. Assuming the continuous development of our (as MTABS
    model assumes, combined) technological and societal progress(es) we will at some point come to a decision point.
    Will we set the long-term course for abandoning our own star (building habitats that can travel in interstellar
    space, avoiding calamities of almost any proportion and charging up on hydrogen from others stars nearby) or will we
    commit to maintaining our star for eons (as in a trillion years) to come? This is a key decision that could have
    far-reaching outcomes for the entire galaxy (which, if we, collectively as a galaxy, maintain the optimal course
    will undoubtedly be more capable as a result and could en-masse take on even greater tasks like moving entire star
    systems out of the way of destructive novas and black holes). Undoubtedly the achieved increased level of galactic
    coordination (inspired by us and other geographically unrelated to us "children" signing up for "the program") will
    reduce stagnation, eliminate the drastic measures taken improve it, and the level of all types of conflict
    everywhere in the galaxy, making the Milky Way a moving force that can take on the one natural problem placed in
    front of it.
</p>
<h2>Galaxy</h2>
<p>
    To the best of our understanding, the Milky Way is set to crash into the Andromeda galaxy sometime in (for us very
    for others very much not so) distant future. But what if we all, collectively could "steer the ship" away from the
    collision? Certainly, it would take a great deal of effort from everyone (on both sides of the problem). MTABS model
    proposes a way for us to join the "get the pinwheel past the dandelion" plan, in this very century. After all, a
    cosmic birth is critical not only for the newborn but for his family and thus has an impact on the entire village
    that helps to raise him (and others) as he (the the ones he friends with) grow up. And if there are indeed several
    children being born (more or less) at once in the same house and even more move into that same house - the social
    life of the whole community gets greatly impacted. Impacted for the better.

<p>
    Could there be an intergalactic problem of keeping the greater locally in balance? Could we eventually help avoid
    even greater clamities? <b>Update 7/24/2024</b> Could all of the galaxies around the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Attractor">local gravitational center</a> increase their centripetal
    velocity prevent it from potentially collapsing in and causing a (seen before) limited Big Bang?
