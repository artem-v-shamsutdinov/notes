    <b>Added: 1/17/2025</b> Age One - Earth: Preserving Earth's climate and resources, taking care of its biosphere ensures our own existence. By preventing self-caused damage to Earth not only are we benefiting everyone in the long term, we ourselves benefit, here as we are now and as we will be in for the foreseeable future. God's given Earth is and will be our home and it's in our own interests to take best care of it.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
    <b>Added: 1/16/2025</b> Phase 6: We are the keepers of Earth and in the ages to come will ensure its future, make sure life continues on it and 
    preserve its resources from our own and external exploitation.  For as long as we continue living on Earth we are 
    by default its protectors and will make sure that its water, its minerals and its energy resources remain on it, 
    that its atmosphere is not extracted from it. As long as we are on Earth we are the interested and responsible
    party who will ensure that it continues to support life.  In the long term all of the flora and fauna on Earth will
    depend on us for their continued existence. Until the next evolutionary cycle and the subsequent technological
    development of the next intelligent dry-surface beings on Earth we are directly responsible for ensuring that life,
    our unique version of it, continues and thrives here.  Across the progressions of the MTABS mode the beginning of
    this period of strengthening lines up with all of the inhabitants of the Solar System concluding internal violent 
    conflict and enabling creation of common defensive safety (among other things) infrastructure to protect our
    planets and Sun (and, per the MTABS model progressions, subsequently in the following Phase 7 to protect Sun's
    long-term existence and thus long-term existence of the Solar System).

<p class="paragraph">
    Phase 7: MTABS model started as a listing of accomplishments to be made by humanity to achieve the goals of eternal Sun and
    Earth and to contribute to greater long term Galactic goals. After a period of reflection the underlying life-cycle
    driver of the model provided a perspective in which humanity starts at its stellar birth and continues through
    growing,
    family and extended family building ages and beyond. Naturally (even instinctively), humanity needs to be rooted in
    realities of planetary life in order to successfully <a

    protect upcoming races to interstellar travel and beyond. Having a physical stake in maintaining the eternal life cycle of the Sun and remaining on Earth until
    it is ready for another birthing cycle will ensure the correct mindset, help co-accomplish long term Galactic goals and
    improve life cycles of future races in the Solar System and beyond.

<p class="paragraph">
    <b>Moved down: 1/16/2025</b> Phase 8: Distant future past the scope of the MTABS model.  In general, in it's <a

    commitment to it's home planet and star will enable it to correctly guide a multitude of newer races at various stages of
    development.
