MTABS model started as a listing of accomplishments to be made by humanity to achieve the goals of eternal Sun and
Earth and to contribute to greater long term Galactic goals. After a period of reflection the underlying life-cycle
driver of the model provided a perspective in which humanity starts at its stellar birth and continues through growing,
family and extended family building ages and beyond. Naturally (even instinctively), humanity needs to be rooted in
realities of planetary life in order to successfully <a

protect upcoming races to interstellar travel and beyond. Beyond, in it's <a

to it's home planet and star will enable it to correctly guide a multitude of newer races at various stages of
development. Having a physical stake in maintaining the eternal life cycle of the Sun and remaining on Earth until it is
ready for another birthing cycle will ensure the correct mindset, help co-accomplish long term Galactic goals and
improve life cycles of future races in the Solar System and beyond.
