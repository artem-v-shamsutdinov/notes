It may make sense to read the <a href="../timescale_progression/MTABS_Timescale_Progression.html">MTABS Timescale
    progression</a> first.

<p>
    The very phrase - "May there always be Sunshine" and the emotional charge of <a
        href="../../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#may-there-always-be-sunshine-beginning">the associated song</a> is
    all about ensuring that the Earth which is giving us life now and the Sun that is giving the Earth and us the energy
    for life to be possible, continue to do so for us and our systemic siblings for all of eternity.

<h2>Kardashev 2</h2>
Added 8/22/2024
<br>
<p>
    The MTABS model can be mapped on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev Scale</a> but
    it isn't clear exactly what level later Phases fit in. Phases below 6 can be safely assumed to be below 2 on
    Kardashev's Scale. Phases below 9 can also be pretty easily mapped below 3 Kardashev. The question then becomes do
    Phases 9 and especially 10 require over 3 Kardashev?
</p>
<p>
    Phase 10 is probably so far away from our capabilities that it's just not worth focusing on at this point - we just
    can't see far enough out of the Milky Way to understand the full picture. But, no matter what the Andromeda
    situation is (and it has <a
        href="https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-may-escape-fated-collision-andromeda-galaxy">recently
        been questioned</a>) Phase 9 business requires enormous amounts of energy. And if Phase 9 can be accomplished on
    a level closer to Kardashev 2, using machines that power directly from stars, can the combined civilizations of a
    Galaxy accomplish Phase 9 goals while <b>Linked 8/23/2024</b> <a
        href="./Our_way-MTABS_view.html#interstellar-habitats">remaining solely on their home planets</a>? The answer to
    this question is hard to arrive at logically given only what we commonly know now.
</p>
<p>
    From this logic follows - if we (collectively as a Galaxy) must build Earth-like artificial habitats and exist in
    many interstellar locations to prevent Galactic Cataclysms, does that conflict with MTABS eternal focus on Earth and
    Sun?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is simple - we are nowhere near the level of societal and technological development necessary to
    contribute to galactic projects. On the contrary, the MTABS hypothesis is that by focusing on our own planet first
    and ensuring the most optimal arrival at Kardashev 1 we will set the most optimal course for the next step.
    Subsequently then, by concentrating our focus on the Sun we will naturally plot the most optimal course to arrive at
    Kardashev 2.
</p>
<p>
    The key assumption present in MTABS is that it will take time (lots of time by our measure) to arrive at Kardashev
    1. And subsequently, it will continue to take even more time to arrive at Kardashev 2. But, without focusing on our
    own planet first and then on our own star it could be argued that we would arrive at those milestones either too
    late or never at all.

Hypothesis assumes alike backward progression, with early fossil fuel age lasting ~ from 13XX CE (when coal began to
be used for domestic heating) to ~195X CE and mid Earth surface fuel from ?~4XXX BCE? to 13XX CE (assumed start of
human civilization on Earth)
<br>

NOTE:
<br>
The guaranteed work, the associated guaranteed living and the resulting removal of the Hidden Threat of Violence
experiment in the USSR was further supported by the experiment in a multi-tiered representative democracy with open
(publically known) votes and the ability to recall delegates from any level of the representation hierarchy. All of the
innovations should have increased accountability of the delegates thus leading to more accurately representative
decisions at all levels of the governing hierarchy. However, the transfer of power to this governing body was never
completed.
<br>
Similar Hidden Threat of Violence reducing guaranteed work schemes are present in other state-over-capital systems.

United Nations of "~ -70 - 0" are assumed to be an instrument of sovereignty of the leading nation(s). UN of "0 -
~ 70" is expected to be an instrument of (at least at this stage near-)sovereign, near-Continental blocks of nations.
<br>
<br>
NOTE:

Modern Tribal violence is assumed to be isolated (not predominant across the world), mostly externally caused by
advanced divide and conquer techniques. Same applies at lower and higher levels.

Contiental means a large portion of earth Surface. In Africa vague geographical boundaries of North, East, West,
South and Central factor in a complex, slowly unifying framework during "balance of forces" and "safety" stages.
In Asia rough geographial splits of North (Eurasia), East, South-East and South-West factor in the "balance of
forces" and "safety" stages.
<br>
West Asia (Middle East) and the Sub-Continentally transitional Afganistan connect the Old World (with the assumption of
South East Asia being a connecting (Sub-)Continentaly connecting region). Thus it takes influence from all of these
regions (with the assumption of the recurring East Asian directed westward influence). Thus it may experience delayed
Continental stage progression (but, interestingly enough, perhaps ahead of time Global progression).
<br>
Continental Opinion:
<br>
North Eurasia (CIS + possibly Korea + possibly Japan) is expected to stay unified through the 3
Contientnal stages as a stabilizing (and if needed protective) (relatively) "barbarian" force for the 3 cradles of
civilization below, in case of an extraterrestrial (progressively less likely) attack on (logically assumed
progression of) SA->NA->EU.
<br>
<br>
NOTE:
<br>
Planetary stages are focused on dry-surface. A different balance of forces will be maintained in the Oceans as
progressively more aquatic species populate more oceanic space (expecting Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, South China
Sea, ?Celebes Sea?, ?Arafura Sea - Banda Sea? progression).
<br>

<br>
Hypothesis assumes optimally minimal usage of Earth deuterium and subsequently System deuterium for use by future
technologically intelligent species.
<br>
<br>
NOTE:
<br>
The to-date development of the Galactic balance of forces is assumed to already cycled through at least once (with
progressive improvements over time), thus placing us into a current balance of forces as a "protected" civilization.
But, given to the constant inflow of the <a
    href="../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2024_06_14_4-No_threat_of_violence.html#No_Threat_of_Violence_progression">lower level</a> "No Threat of
Violence" civilizations, the cycle is assumed to repeat continuously (though with both evolutionary and situational
improvements). This goes along with the assumption of the continous (albeit slow) reduction of the Threat of Violence
for the Galaxy as a whole.
<br>
<br>
NOTE:
<br>
The balance of forces is expected to be enforced on many levels, with higher levels being progressively removed from the
yet-to-be interstellar (star-systemic) and below levels of civilizations. Thus, our logically derived (and
multi-occuring, circumbstatial evidence inspired) centinel is assumed to belong to a lower than the Galactic (or maybe
even Sub-Galactic) balance of forces level. However, if Galactic garrisoning (or even Sub-Galactic guarding) is already
well developed then the (at the very least) near-Sun balance of forces may be at a higher level of stability.
<br>
<br id="assumed-to-be-near-space-present-significant-machinery">
NOTE:
<br>
The "real-space" situation in the Galaxy is likely extremely complex to due galagraphic and historical reasons. Thus
the probability of the uniformity of even the Galactic (or even Sub-Galactic or below) security situation is extremely
low. Therefore, the probability of dangerous, lower level inbalances of forces must be present (thow less likely with
the slow passage of time). At the time of writing, given the (thank God) low level of available evidence, it is very
difficult to logically derive the risks for our planet and our species on it. The assumption is - there are large (Jupiter
size +) interstellar habitats (<b>Added: 1/15/2025</b> possibly a la mini
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson spheres</a> with a heat and light source in the center,
weight spread around the outer walls with habitable space on the inside of the wall, possibly related to the
stand-alone Jupiter size planets in interstellar space and supported by a single recorded possible, very vague instance
of refueling against the sun), fueling off (even not very dangerous, though temporarily a bit too energetic) stars and
there are centinels, capable of piercing those habitats (<b>Added: 1/15/2025</b> half-Earth sided tetrahedrons with 3
sides elongated, leading to a sharper-ended vertex, supported by possible, vague photogaphical evidence of one entering
Sun's corona and subsequent disputed photographical evidence of a group of them much farther away from the Sun). And (
based on a single occurence of a dimming of Betelgeuse, and previously supported by imaginary queries) there are assumed
to be (presumably much bigger) machines big enough to cause a temporary reduction of energy output of supernova-class
stars (a la Betelgeuse).
<br>
<br>
NOTE:
<br>
We should be aware of the still possible Balance of Forces affecting the cataclysmic K-Pg extinction event and the much
farther removed and thus less likely still affecting (but more impactful) extinction of life on the surface of Mars
event.
<br>
<br id="NLNM_beyond_Earth">
NOTE <b>Added 10/4/2024</b>:
<br>
Institution NLNM combat and its eventual expansion to progressively larger (inter-planetary and interstellar) levels may
prevent hypothetical (and morally wrong) external introduction of (engineered) societal <b>Fixed 1/27/2025</b> chaos (in
possible, last
resort attempts to prevent long-term stagnation of development of species and its eventual extinction, or given
sufficient development, pre-leading stage transition). <b>Added 1/27/2025</b> This assumption is based purely on a
(subsequent to published commitment to NLNM implementation) dream of an apparently superiorly orchestrated defense scare
on a non-prepared world (with no demonstrated signs of combat), likely stopped by an introduction of an
extra-planetary/habitat NLNM contingent.
<br>

NOTE:
<br>
Finally, for those of us with more resources to evaluate Multi (and Greater) Parsec star system composition (and
possible planetary composition): the enery output of the Sun, its stage, the number of (especially inner) planets and
oceanic moons - it all factors into our "localized" (and progressively less up the chain) balance of forces. And of
course, alike but much more informed (external) projections of future balances of forces (that do factor in our local
systemagraphy and history) are probably also taken into account.

<h2>Manage own "house" first</h2>
Updated: 8/22/2024
<br>
<p>
    There may be a multitude of very good, even nobile reasons why older civilizations could
    choose nomadic lifestyles, (logically) in environments with perfectly reproduced conditions. Localized presence may
    be required to pull and push dark matter towards or away from the galactic center to control its speed and
    acceleration, or maintaining clusters of manageable black holes may be required to control galaxy's direction. Or
    maybe it's sub-galactic or even just regional matters - we just don't know. No matter the level of work would
    require that, loosing focus on our home world and star is <a href="possible-direction-of-progression">not the way
        forward</a>. With that attitude MTABS principles argue that before we join the galactic workforce our time is
    best spent focusing on what is and will always be important to us - our planet, with all of its natural
    imperfections and problems. And, once we are managing Earth our time will be best spent focusing on managing our
    star. The MTABS hypothesis is that only by sequentially focusing on those two things first we'll we trully be able
    to contribute to regional and eventually sub-galactic and even galactic projects.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> Of course, other scenarios are possible. Maybe early Kardashev 2 civilizations face a crisis
    of ascension into that level, at which point one of the possible outcomes is growing your population via building
    very large habitats that are gravitationally and atmospherically equivalent to their homeworlds but can support an
    order of magnitude (or even two orders of magnitude) higher population (perhaps given a much larger surface area).
    And of course, in a good way, there would be any number of functional reasons for such habitats, ranging from
    providing material support and security to lesser developed yet still very busy civilizations to (potentially)
    dealing with geographic issues.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> One can only hope that building inter-stellar habitats is not a dead-end way that prevents a
    civilization from ever joining (the other galactic civilizations) in building (or maintaining, as we just don't know
    the state of things in the Milky Way) a Kardashev 3 level system.
</p>
<h2>Lifecycle View</h2>
Updated: 8/22/2024
<p>
    MTABS draws parallels between a human lifecycle and the lifecycle of humanity as a whole, but without a terminal
    death, arguing that just as humans should eventually live to 700 years of age, and with passing eons potentially
    achieve (besides the given at spiritual level) physical and mental immortality, so should should humanity. This is
    the other necessary component of MTABS:
</p>
<i>
    May there always be Sun(shine),
    <br>
    May there always be Heaven(s),
    <br>
    May there always be Mama,
    <br>
    May there always be I.
</i>
<p>
    Just as everyone should enjoy the luxury of having their parents around (at least while they bring up their children
    and grandchildren) we should (at the very least in our infancy and childhood) have the luxury of being on our mother
    planet, with our star. MTABS argues that joining the galactic workforce in "stellar infancy" (per the model &lt;
    700,000 years from now, <b>Update 8/23/2024</b> given the broad assumption that equates 1 million rotations around
    the
    Sun to one year of a galactic-level civilization, specifically for our civilization) would not contribute to the
    solution of galactic problems. Subsequently, the lifecycle parallel continues that like of reasoning: Why go to
    "regional childcare" at 3 weeks if nothing is forcing your mother to shift her attention until you are 3 years of
    age?
</p>
<p>
    And the argument extends that doing so in "early galactic childhood" won't do much good either: why go to a boarding
    school from first grade? And even beyond, in near-Kandrashev 2 "school and college years" - why go to an elite
    university (to build connections that you can just as easily build later with far fewer mistakes) if what you really
    need is a good education and the support of your family (occasional, exploratory travel based friendships aside).
    And even as we take on long term parenting roles over newer species and "build and grow our new interstellar family",
    our primary focus should be the challenges of our family not those of the city. Even as adults who take care of our
    children, we miss "mom's cooking and father's advice". Hence, if you are not disabled by "old age", why serve your
    country (wider galactic region - a large fraction of the galaxy) and planet (the galaxy) before you've helped with
    your (?wider galactic-regional?) grandchildren and maybe even played with your (?galactic?) great-grandchildren?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> Or, perhaps more correctly, as we get involved in facilitating the development of younger
    species
    (which the MTABS model assumes to be the natural course of things) (after a good period of "growing up time", ~25
    million years from now) directly, we will likely be involved in lesser-regional affairs that deal with our region
    and the region of the "parented" intelligent (at least technologically, or yet semi-intelligent) species. Then
    subsequently, as we progress to more of a support role of a larger number of the "brought up" early stage "parents",
    and further develop our technological and industrial capabilities (~50 million years from now) we would naturally be
    involved in the affairs of our greater region of the galaxy. Subsequently, via the logically following, natural
    expansion of influence, combined with a more hands-off approach, and as we gain the necessary (very mass scale)
    equipment and galactic-maintenance capacities, we would finally start to be involved in galactic matters.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, MTABS hypothesis argues that it will take (per the model) at least 70+ million years of "family work"
    before we can trully take on wider community projects.
