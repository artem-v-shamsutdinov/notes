    The very phrase - "May there always be Sunshine" and the emotional charge of <a
        href="../../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#may-there-always-be-sunshine-beginning">the associated song</a> is
    all about ensuring that the Earth which is giving us life now and the Sun that is giving the Earth and us the energy
    for life to be possible, continue to do so for us and our systemic siblings for all of eternity.

<h2>Kardashev 2</h2>
Added 8/22/24
<br>
<p>
    The MTABS model can be mapped on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev Scale</a> but
    it isn't clear exactly what level later Phases fit in. Phases below 6 can be safely assumed to be below 2 on
    Kardashev's Scale. Phases below 9 can also be pretty easily mapped below 3 Kardashev. The question then becomes do
    Phases 9 and especially 10 require over 3 Kardashev?
</p>
<p>
    Phase 10 is probably so far away from our capabilities that it's just not worth focusing on at this point - we just
    can't see far enough out of the Milky Way to understand the full picture. But, no matter what the Andromeda
    situation is
    (and it has <a
        href="https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-may-escape-fated-collision-andromeda-galaxy">recently
        been
        questioned</a>) Phase 9 business requires enormous amounts of energy. And if Phase 9 can be accomplished on a
    level
    closer to Kardashev 2, using machines that power directly from stars, can the combined civilizations of a Galaxy
    accomplish Phase 9 goals while remaining solely on their home planets? The answer to this question is hard to arrive
    at
    logically given only what we commonly know now.
</p>
<p>
    From this logic follows - if we (collectively as a Galaxy) must build Earth-like artificial habitats and exist in
    many interstellar locations to prevent Galactic Cataclysms, does that conflict with MTABS eternal focus on Earth and
    Sun?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is simple - we are nowhere near the level of societal and technological development necessary to
    contribute to galactic projects. On the contrary, the MTABS hypothesis is that by focusing on our own planet first
    and ensuring the most optimal arrival at Kardashev 1 we will set the most optimal course for the next step.
    Subsequently then, by concentrating our focus on the Sun we will naturally plot the most optimal course to arrive at
    Kardashev 2.
</p>
<p>
    The key assumption present in MTABS is that it will take time (lots of time by our measure) to arrive at Kardashev
    1. And subsequently, it will continue to take even more time to arrive at Kardashev 2. But, without focusing on our
    own planet first and then on our own star it could be argued that we would arrive at those milestones either too
    late or never at all.

<h2>First manage own house</h2>
Updated: 8/22/24
<br>
<p>
    To put it in another way, there may be a multitude of very good, even nobile reasons why older civilizations could
    choose nomadic lifestyles, (logically) in environments with perfectly reproduced conditions. Localized presence may
    be required to pull and push dark matter towards or away from the galactic center to control its speed and
    acceleration, or maintaining clusters of manageable black holes may be required to control galaxy's direction. Or
    maybe it's sub-galactic or even just regional matters - we just don't know. No matter the level of work would
    require that, loosing focus on our home world and star is not the way forward. With that attitude MTABS principles
    argue that before we join the galactic workforce our time is best spent focusing on what is and will always be
    important to us - our planet, with all of its natural imperfections and problems. And, once we are managing Earth
    our time will be best spent focusing on managing our star. The MTABS hypothesis is that only by sequentially
    focusing on those two things first we'll we trully be able to contribute to regional and eventually sub-galactic and
    even galactic projects.
</p>
<h2>Lifecycle View</h2>
Updated: 8/22/24
<p>
    MTABS draws parallels between a human lifecycle and the lifecycle of humanity as a whole, but without a terminal
    death, arguing that just as humans should eventually live to 700 years of age, and with passing eons potentially
    achieve (besides the given at spiritual level) physical and mental immortality, so should should humanity. This is
    the other necessary component of MTABS:
</p>
<i>
    May there always be Sun(shine),
    <br>
    May there always be Heaven(s),
    <br>
    May there always be Mama,
    <br>
    May there always be I.
</i>
<p>
    Just as everyone should enjoy the luxury of having their parents around (at least while they bring up their children
    and grandchildren) we should (at the very least in our infancy and childhood) have the luxury of being on our mother
    planet, with our star. MTABS argues that joining the galactic workforce in "stellar infancy" (per the model &lt;
    700,000 years from now) would not contribute to the solution of galactic problems. Subsequently, the lifecycle
    parallel continues that like of reasoning: Why go to "regional childcare" at 3 weeks if nothing is forcing your
    mother to shift her attention until you are 3 years of age?
</p>
<p>
    And the argument extends that doing so in "early galactic childhood" won't do much good either: why go to a boarding
    school from first grade? And even beyond, in near-Kandrashev 2 "school and college years" - why go to an elite
    university (to build connections that you can just as easily build later with far fewer mistakes) if what you really
    need is a good education and the support of your family (occasional, exploratory travel based friendships aside).
    And even as we take on long term parenting roles over newer races and "build and grow our new interstellar family",
    our primary focus should be the challenges of our family not those of the city. Even as adults who take care of our
    children, we miss "mom's cooking and father's advice". Hence, if you are not disabled by "old age", why serve your
    country (wider galactic region - a large fraction of the galaxy) and planet (the galaxy) before you've helped with
    your (?wider galactic-regional?) grandchildren and maybe even played with your (?galactic?) great-grandchildren?
</p>
<p>
    Thus, MTABS hypothesis argues that it will take (per the model) at least 70 million years of "family work"
    before we can trully take on wider community projects.
