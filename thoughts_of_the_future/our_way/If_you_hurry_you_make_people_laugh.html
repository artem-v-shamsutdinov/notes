    The very phrase - "May there always be Sunshine" and the emotional charge of <a href="../../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#may-there-always-be-sunshine-beginning">the associated song</a> is all about
    ensuring that the Earth which is giving us life now and the Sun that is giving the Earth and us the energy for life
    to be possible, continue to do so for us and our systemic siblings for all of eternity.

    There may be a multitude of very good, even nobile reasons why older civilizations could choose nomadic lifestyles,
    (logically) in environments with perfectly reproduced conditions. Localized presence may be required to pull and
    push dark matter towards or away from the galactic center to control its speed and acceleration, or maintaining
    clusters of manageable black holes may be required to control galaxy's direction - we just don't know. MTABS argues that
    before we join the galactic workforce our time is best spent focusing on what is and will always be important to us
    - our planet, with all of its natural imperfections and problems. And, once we are capable of it and well before we'll
    trully be able to contribute to galactic projects, our time will be best spent focusing on our star.

    MTABS draws parallels between a human lifecycle and the lifecycle of humanity as a whole, but without a terminal death, arguing
    that just as humans should eventually live to 700 years of age, and with passing eons potentially achieve (besides the given at
    spiritual level) physical and mental immortality, so should should humanity.  This is the other necessary component of MTABS:

    May there always be Sun(shine),

    May there always be Heaven(s),

    May there always be Mama,

    May there always be I.

    Just as everyone should enjoy the luxury of having their parents around (at least while they bring up their children
    and grandchildren) we should (at the very least in our infancy and childhood) have the luxury of being on our mother
    planet, with our star. MTABS argues that joining the galactic workforce in infancy ( &lt; 700,000 years) would not
    contribute to the solution of galactic problems: Why go to childcare at 3 weeks if nothing is forcing your
    mother to shift her attention until you are 3 years of age? And the argument extends that doing so in early
    childhood won't do much good either: why go to a boarding school from first grade? And even beyond, in school
    and college years - why go to an elite university to build connections that you can just as easily build later
    with far fewer mistakes if what you really need is a good education and the support of your family. And even as
    we build and grow our family, our primary focus should be the challenges of our family not those of the city. Even
    as adults who take care of our children, we miss "mom's cooking and father's advice". Hence, if you
    are not disabled by old age, why serve your country and planet before you've helped with your grandchildren and
    played with your great-grandchildren?
