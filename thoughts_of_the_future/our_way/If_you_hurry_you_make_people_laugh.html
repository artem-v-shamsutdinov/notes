    The very phrase - "May there always be Sunshine" and the emotional charge of the associated song is all about
    ensuring that the Earth that is giving us life now and the Sun that is giving the Earth and us the energy for life
    to be possible, continue to do so for us and our systemic siblings for all of eternity.

    There may be a multitude of very good, even mobile reasons why older civilizations could choose nomadic lifestyles,
    (logically) in environments with perfectly reproduced conditions. Localized presence may be required to pull and
    push dark matter towards or away from the galactic center to control its speed and acceleration, or maintaining
    clusters of manageable black holes may be required to control its direction - we just don't know. MTABS argues that
    before we join the galactic workforce our time is best spent focusing on what is and will always be important to us
    - our planet, with all of its natural imperfections and problems. And, once we are capable, of focusing on our
    star.

    Just as everyone should enjoy the luxury of having their parents around (at least while they bring up their children
    and grandchildren) we should (at the very least in our infancy and childhood) have the luxury of being on our mother
    planet, with our star. MTABS argues that joining the galactic workforce in infancy ( &lt; 700,000 years) would not
    contribute to the solution of galactic problems: Why go to childcare at 3 weeks if nothing is forcing your
    mother to shift her attention until you are 3 years of age? And the argument extends that doing so in early
    childhood won't do much good either: why go to a boarding school from first grade? And even beyond, in school
    and college years - why go to an elite university to build connections that you can just as easily build later
    with far fewer mistakes if what you really need is a good education and the support of your family. And even as
    we build and grow our family our primary focus should be the challenges our family not those of the city. And
    certainly, even as adults who take care of our children, we miss "mom's cooking and father's advice" . If you
    are not disabled by old age, why serve your state and country before you've helped with your grandchildren and
    played with your great-grandchildren?
