<h2>Kardashev 2</h2>
Added 8/22/2024
<br>
<p>
    The MTABS model can be mapped on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev Scale</a> but
    it isn't clear exactly what level later Phases fit in. Phases below 6 can be safely assumed to be below 2 on
    Kardashev's Scale. Phases below 9 can also be pretty easily mapped below 3 Kardashev. The question then becomes do
    Phases 9 and especially 10 require over 3 Kardashev?
</p>
<p>
    Phase 10 is probably so far away from our capabilities that it's just not worth focusing on at this point - we just
    can't see far enough out of the Milky Way to understand the full picture. But, no matter what the Andromeda
    situation is (and it has <a
        href="https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-may-escape-fated-collision-andromeda-galaxy">recently
        been questioned</a>) Phase 9 business requires enormous amounts of energy. And if Phase 9 can be accomplished on
    a level closer to Kardashev 2, using machines that power directly from stars, can the combined civilizations of a
    Galaxy accomplish Phase 9 goals while <b>Linked 8/23/2024</b> <a
        href="./Our_way-MTABS_view.html#interstellar-habitats">remaining solely on their home planets</a>? The answer to
    this question is hard to arrive at logically given only what we commonly know now.
</p>
<p>
    From this logic follows - if we (collectively as a Galaxy) must build Earth-like artificial habitats and exist in
    many interstellar locations to prevent Galactic Cataclysms, does that conflict with MTABS eternal focus on Earth and
    Sun?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is simple - we are nowhere near the level of societal and technological development necessary to
    contribute to galactic projects. On the contrary, the MTABS hypothesis is that by focusing on our own planet first
    and ensuring the most optimal arrival at Kardashev 1 we will set the most optimal course for the next step.
    Subsequently then, by concentrating our focus on the Sun we will naturally plot the most optimal course to arrive at
    Kardashev 2.
</p>
<p>
    The key assumption present in MTABS is that it will take time (lots of time by our measure) to arrive at Kardashev
    1. And subsequently, it will continue to take even more time to arrive at Kardashev 2. But, without focusing on our
    own planet first and then on our own star it could be argued that we would arrive at those milestones either too
    late or never at all.

<h2>Manage own "house" first</h2>
Updated: 8/22/2024
<br>
<p>
    There may be a multitude of very good, even nobile reasons why older civilizations could
    choose nomadic lifestyles, (logically) in environments with perfectly reproduced conditions. Localized presence may
    be required to pull and push dark matter towards or away from the galactic center to control its speed and
    acceleration, or maintaining clusters of manageable black holes may be required to control galaxy's direction. Or
    maybe it's sub-galactic or even just regional matters - we just don't know. No matter the level of work would
    require that, loosing focus on our home world and star is not the way forward. With that attitude MTABS principles
    argue that before we join the galactic workforce our time is best spent focusing on what is and will always be
    important to us - our planet, with all of its natural imperfections and problems. And, once we are managing Earth
    our time will be best spent focusing on managing our star. The MTABS hypothesis is that only by sequentially
    focusing on those two things first we'll we trully be able to contribute to regional and eventually sub-galactic and
    even galactic projects.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> Of course, other scenarios are possible. Maybe early Kardashev 2 civilizations face a crisis
    of ascension into that level, at which point one of the possible outcomes is growing your population via building
    very large habitats that are gravitationally and atmospherically equivalent to their homeworlds but can support an
    order of magnitude (or even two orders of magnitude) higher population (perhaps given a much larger surface area).
    And of course, in a good way, there would be any number of functional reasons for such habitats, ranging from
    providing material support and security to lesser developed yet still very busy civilizations to (potentially)
    dealing with geographic issues.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> One can only hope that building inter-stellar habitats is not a dead-end way that prevents a
    civilization from ever joining (the other galactic civilizations) in building (or maintaining, as we just don't know
    the state of things in the Milky Way) a Kardashev 3 level system.
</p>
<h2>Lifecycle View</h2>
Updated: 8/22/2024
<p>
    MTABS draws parallels between a human lifecycle and the lifecycle of humanity as a whole, but without a terminal
    death, arguing that just as humans should eventually live to 700 years of age, and with passing eons potentially
    achieve (besides the given at spiritual level) physical and mental immortality, so should should humanity. This is
    the other necessary component of MTABS:
</p>
<i>
    May there always be Sun(shine),
    <br>
    May there always be Heaven(s),
    <br>
    May there always be Mama,
    <br>
    May there always be I.
</i>
<p>
    Just as everyone should enjoy the luxury of having their parents around (at least while they bring up their children
    and grandchildren) we should (at the very least in our infancy and childhood) have the luxury of being on our mother
    planet, with our star. MTABS argues that joining the galactic workforce in "stellar infancy" (per the model &lt;
    700,000 years from now, <b>Update 8/23/2024</b> given the broad assumption that equates 1 million rotations around
    the
    Sun to one year of a galactic-level civilization, specifically for our civilization) would not contribute to the
    solution of galactic problems. Subsequently, the lifecycle parallel continues that like of reasoning: Why go to
    "regional childcare" at 3 weeks if nothing is forcing your mother to shift her attention until you are 3 years of
    age?
</p>
<p>
    And the argument extends that doing so in "early galactic childhood" won't do much good either: why go to a boarding
    school from first grade? And even beyond, in near-Kandrashev 2 "school and college years" - why go to an elite
    university (to build connections that you can just as easily build later with far fewer mistakes) if what you really
    need is a good education and the support of your family (occasional, exploratory travel based friendships aside).
    And even as we take on long term parenting roles over newer races and "build and grow our new interstellar family",
    our primary focus should be the challenges of our family not those of the city. Even as adults who take care of our
    children, we miss "mom's cooking and father's advice". Hence, if you are not disabled by "old age", why serve your
    country (wider galactic region - a large fraction of the galaxy) and planet (the galaxy) before you've helped with
    your (?wider galactic-regional?) grandchildren and maybe even played with your (?galactic?) great-grandchildren?

    <b>Added 8/23/2024</b> Or, perhaps more correctly, as we get involved in facilitating the development of younger
    races
    (which the MTABS model assumes to be the natural course of things) (after a good period of "growing up time", ~25
    million years from now) directly, we will likely be involved in lesser-regional affairs that deal with our region
    and the region of the "parented" intelligent (at least technologically, or yet semi-intelligent) species. Then
    subsequently, as we progress to more of a support role of a larger number of the "brought up" early stage "parents",
    and further develop our technological and industrial capabilities (~50 million years from now) we would naturally be
    involved in the affairs of our greater region of the galaxy. Subsequently, via the logically following, natural
    expansion of influence, combined with a more hands-off approach, and as we gain the necessary (very mass scale)
    equipment and galactic-maintenance capacities, we would finally start to be involved in galactic matters.

    Thus, MTABS hypothesis argues that it will take (per the model) at least 70+ million years of "family work"
    before we can trully take on wider community projects.
