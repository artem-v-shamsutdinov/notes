<h1>The refugees and the Sun</h1>
Our solar system is over 4.5 billion years old. The universe is over 13.7 billion years old. It is possible that 6
billion years after its creation there were already enough heavy elements in some parts (of probably the vast majority
of galaxies) to develop life (with the assumption of universality of life). That would mean that the first life appeared
billions of years before the creation of our Solar System. Given that by the universal law of evolution (wherever
possible) all habitats eventually develop intelligent (and thus eventually space-faring) life. And given that we all
keep on building ever bigger machines, perhaps the 200,000-year span of the creation of our Solar System could have been
intelligently affected to cause the creation of such a beautiful Solar System (instead of the usual super giant planets
that we keep on finding). Compared to the (so far) most identified planetary systems it appears to be a colorful and
pretty playground in the middle of a neighborhood.
<br>
<br>
No matter the past of our Solar System we are taught in schools that our sun is to eventually explode. As we progress
in age and start thinking about the long-term we begin to wonder how our more advanced descendants will be able to solve
this problem.
<br>
<br>
We don't know what the story of our Solar System could be. Guessing at it is as good watching dreams, reading up on
related topics and creating fairytales from them:

    <a href="../../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#solar_system_creation_hypothesis">45 years ago</a> the wise city
    elders laid out a plan for a new community around a lake. It had 2 big plots, 1 medium plot, and a bunch of ponds
    that mostly formed around hills. When the grounds were finally formed a rich developer pushed through a permit on a
    luxurious residence in the medium plot (3rd from the lake). Soon other citizens realized that this ongoing project
    (and its future residents) would dominate it and cause problems for residents of the two big plots closest to the
    lake (and the huts at the ponds). So, 10 years ago (given the grave differences between the parties and after a
    heated battle) the medium plot was forcefully repossessed and cleared, dropping the construction until some future
    time. Then, 5 years ago, active construction finally started in the big plot second from the center. But things were
    moving so slowly that by the time construction would finish the lake in the center of the community would no longer
    be maintainable. So 8 months ago the authorities tore down the house on that lot to its foundation and a developer
    built (in an expedited manner) a roomy house on top of that foundation. Yesterday the tenants arrived in it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The tenants of the 2nd plot from the lake are about to start taking care of the new community and its ponds but they
    won't be able to maintain the lake by themselves. Someone will have to build houses on the first plot, which is too
    close to the lake and gets flooded, and on the third plot, which is too far away from the lake and can't get the
    water for its needs. Some earthmoving will have to be done.

<br>
<br>
Given this setting, who should move into the community? They would have to get along with the tenants of the second plot
and with the tenants of the huts (at the ponds) and work together to maintain the lake. Should it be the citizens whose
houses are in the worst shape and who soon won't have a place to live? The tenants of the 2nd plot will have work to do
in agreeing (with whoever they have to) on who the best people will be to join the community. Will the joint forces of
the tenants in the inner 3 plots unite to form the core of a strong community in time to solve its problems? Will the
community be strong enough to fix the lake before it could become a swamp and dry up? Will they successfully leverage
their combined social networks to gain the resources needed to ensure their community's future?

The recent near-solar show of force appeared to be of patrolling nature (possibly a change of the sentinel). And
certainly there are other scenarios of the need to secure a frontier (though given the comparable size of the likely
sentinel that may not be needed) or tying up precious resources that are desperately needed elsewhere (but given the
size of the patrol a single sentinel won't likely make a critical difference). These could be correct and there could be
a multitude of other scenarios but the scenario of refugees is bound to be a statistical certainty and anyone in the
relevant proximity, with the knowledge of the situation and with the capability to help would be morally obligated to do
what they realistically can. What if a star the size of Betelgeuse (a relatively close but for us safely distant
potential supernova) was about to explode and even the most capable of our ancients could only delay its demise? And
what if there was at least one world populated with intelligent beings within the affected area?
<br>
<br>
Being limited in our perception of the situation in our region of the galaxy and the galaxy as a whole it is impossible
to say what the situation will be for Venus and Mars. Likely the territory can't be considered ours even though we (and
the probable dwellers of the ocean planets/moons) grew up here. Likely settling ourselves on any additional planets
isn't a good idea. But we are here and we should check the needs of the people who are to move in. And we better do it
on time - not too early so they don't dominate us with their longer-earned wisdom and capabilities and not too long to
let them save their families and loved ones.
<br>
<br>
If all is well in our region or beyond then there is no reason to rush with the population of Venus or Mars. But the
likelihood of every inhabited world in our region (or beyond) being secure and not at imminent risk of destruction is
likely low. So, the one factor we can only imagine is the severity of the situation for the most desperate candidates to
move in. How much time do they have before they can no longer hold out against a dying star, a polluted overexploited
planet, or any other reason they are about to lose their place to live?
<br>
<br>
If the need is dire we have no time to waste. Certainly, we are not ready for such turbulent events now. But if we start
taking care of "the grounds" and work with the probable dwellers of the "pond huts", we can develop our technological,
industrial and (perhaps most importantly) social capabilities fast enough and be ready in time.
<br>
<br>
No matter what the reality of the situation is, we all need to get along enough to arrive at a better course of events.
To begin with we need to start resolving our own differences peacefully. Or, at the bare minimum, we need to ensure that
our violent conflicts run in an <a href="https://past-the-war.earth">AWU way</a>.
