Our solar system is over 4.5 billion years old. The universe is over 13.7 billion years old. It is possible that 6
billion years after its creation there were already enough heavy elements in some parts (of probably the vast majority)
of galaxies to develop life (with the assumption of universality of life). That would mean that the first life appeared
billions of years before the creation of our Solar System. And certainly by the universal law of evolution
(wherever possible) all habitats eventually develop intelligent (and thus eventually space-faring) life. And given that
we all keep on building ever bigger machines, perhaps the 200,000-year span of the creation of our Solar System could
have been intelligently affected to cause the creation of such a beautiful Solar System (instead of the usual super
giant planets that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiplanetary_systems">we keep on finding</a>).
Compared to the (so far) most identified planetary systems it appears to be a colorful and pretty playground in the
middle of a neighborhood.
<br>
<br>
No matter the past of our Solar System we are taught in schools that our Sun is to eventually explode. As we progress
in age and start thinking about the long-term we begin to wonder how our more advanced descendants will be able to solve
this problem.

We don't know what the story of our Solar System could be. Guessing at it is as good watching dreams, of which I had
three
related to our Solar System (<a href="../../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/I_never_met.html#anonymous-cylindrical-cell-hall-confessions">I

commitment to

    elders laid out a plan for a new community around a lake. It had 2 big plots, 1 medium plot, and a bunch of ponds
    that mostly formed around hills (of which we know little). The lake water was used for city projects, which slowly
    freed up space for the
    inner plots. When the grounds were still forming a rich developer pushed through a permit on a
    luxurious residence in the medium plot (4th from the lake). Soon (presumably) other city dwellers assumed that this
    ongoing project
    (and its future residents) would dominate the new community and cause problems for future residents of the two big
    plots
    closest to the lake (and the huts at the ponds). So, ?10? years ago (given the grave differences between the parties
    and after a heated battle, of which I had a vivid and deeply upsetting dream) the (presumably forth from the lake)
    medium plot was forcefully repossessed and cleared, dropping the construction until some future time. Then, 5 years
    ago, active construction finally started in the big plot third from the lake. But things were moving so slowly
    that by the time construction would finish the lake in the center of the community would no longer be maintainable.
    So 8 months ago the authorities tore down the house on that lot to its foundation and a developer built (in an
    expedited manner) a roomy house on top of that foundation. Yesterday the residents of the new house arrived.
    <br>
    <br>
    The residents of the third plot from the lake are about to start taking care of the new community and its ponds but
    they won't be able to maintain the lake by themselves. Someone will have to build houses on the second plot from the
    lake, which is
    too close to the lake and gets flooded, and on the forth plot (from the lake), which is too far away from the lake
    and can't get the
    water for its needs. Almost certainly the city will have to contribute to get some <a

Given this setting, who should move into the community? They would have to get along with the residents of the second
plot and with the residents of the huts (at the ponds) and work together to maintain the lake. Should it be the citizens
whose neighborhoods or houses are in the worst shape and who soon won't have a place to live? The residents of the third
plot from the lake have work to do in agreeing (with whoever they have to) on who the best people to join the community
will be. Will the residents of the inner 3 plots, including <a
    href="https://youtu.be/3yy-dKTmyOo?si=FDYV67l5xvySrXUL">residents of existing dugouts</a> of <a
    href="https://youtu.be/rwrYX7QLeqI?si=ZqdzeO-C3nru0WOR">?second and forth plots?</a> (I only had a dream about one
dry subsurface species) from the lake that can't even be seen, unite to form the core of <a
    href="https://youtu.be/EVYPt97q3vc?si=d3-WsNoLGe4vDO2h">a strong community</a> in time to
solve its problems? Will the whole community, including the hut dwellers (I did have a 1 second invoked imaginary
thick aquatic tail movement vision but none are required with logical reasoning, reinforced by dots in hexagon formation
seen in
the live stream and eventually understood inferences of large surface crack seen in the museum) be strong enough to
fix the lake before it could become a swamp and dry up? Will they successfully leverage their combined social networks
to gain the resources needed to ensure their community's future?

<b>Updated: 7/9/2024, 1/30/2025</b> The scenario of refugees is bound to be a statistical certainty (and I have did <a
    href="../../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2023/I_never_met.html#anonymous-cylindrical-cell-hall-confessions">a
    dream</a> about unknown slender looking species, possibly in a space faring scenario). What if a star the size of
Betelgeuse (a relatively close but for us safely distant potential supernova) was about to explode and even the most
capable of our ancients could only delay its demise? And what if there was at least one world populated with intelligent
beings within the affected area? The natural conclusion from these questions dictates that anyone within the relevant
proximity of their present location, with the knowledge of the situation and having the capability to help would be
morally obligated to do what they realistically can.
<br>
<br>
Being limited in our perception of the situation in our region of the galaxy and the galaxy as a whole it is impossible
to say what the situation will be for Venus and Mars. Likely the territory can't be considered ours even though we (and
the probable dwellers of the ocean planets/moons <b>Updated: 2/2/2025</b> as well as the possible subsurface inhabitants
of Venus and Mars) grew up here. Likely settling ourselves on any additional planets <a
    href="../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2024_06_14_2-Hypothesizing_a_bit_further.html">isn't a good idea</a>. But we are here and we should
check the needs of the people who are to move in. And we better do it on time - not too early so they don't dominate us
with their longer-earned wisdom and capabilities and not too long to let them save their families and loved ones.
<br>
<br>
If all is well in our region and beyond then there is no reason to rush with the population of Venus or Mars. But the
likelihood of every inhabited world in our region (or beyond) being secure and not at imminent risk of destruction is
likely low. So, the one factor we can only imagine is the severity of the situation for the most desperate candidates to
move in. How much time do they have before they can no longer hold out against a dying star, a polluted overexploited
planet, or any other reason because of which they are about to lose their place to live?
<br>
<br>
If the need is dire we have no time to waste. Certainly, we are not ready for such turbulent events now. But if we start
taking care of "the grounds" and work with the <a href="../https://artem-v-shamsutdinov.github.io/may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/dist/public/2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">probable dwellers</a> of
the "pond huts", we can develop our technological, industrial and (perhaps most importantly) social capabilities in time
to be able to help without hurting ourselves.
<br>
<br>
The above assumptions paint a particular scenario. But, no matter what the reality of the situation is, we all need to
get along enough to arrive at a better course of events (for both external and internal reasons). As we become more
technologically advanced, the risks increase and deadly, mutilating or seriously damaging violence (especially
war) is the one problem we must solve. We need to start resolving our differences peacefully. Or, at the bare minimum,
we need to ensure that our violent conflicts run in an <a href="https://past-the-war.earth">AWU way</a>.
