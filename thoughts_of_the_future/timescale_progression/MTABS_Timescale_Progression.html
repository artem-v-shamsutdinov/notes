<h2>Nuclear fusion energy defines the midpoint of the progression</h2>
<b>Last Update: 1/17/2025</b>
<p>
    MTABS time progression was based on the idea of an hourglass progression in the development of humanity. It is now
    clear that the neck of the hourglass maps to the first utilization of nuclear fusion for energy (possibly the first
    engineering net energy gain). Nuclear fusion (of one form or another) will likely be the main way we get energy for
    millions of years to come. Based on MTABS logic usage of nuclear fusion by humanity will naturally progress through
    at least stages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Utilizing Earth-based deuterium
    </li>
    <li>
        Utilizing Solar System-based fusion material
    </li>
    <li>
        Utilizing hydrogen from the Sun directly
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    After that, the logic that followed MTABS predicts us moving to more advanced sources of energy, of which we are not
    yet sure (could be for example anti-matter, dark-energy, harnessing black holes, or just plain reducing the sizes of
    stars at risk of going novae or supernovae).
</p>
<h2>Hourglass progression</h2>
<p>
    The original MTABS model definition only projects forward but the expected progression also goes backward at roughly
    the same pace....

    The order of magnitude increase was introduced to signify progressively longer periods of time in which we'll find
    ourselves in (or have found ourselves in the past). The constant of 7 was picked in order to find the best pace
    possible at which we could progress forward.
</p>
<h2>Three planets as the measure</h2>

<p>
    The key deciding factor was the timeframe for introducing Solar System-external, dry surface-based civilizations to
    our (at least seemly) vacant lots of Venus and Mars. We would have to be ready in time and at the same time, given
    the constant presence of cosmic calamities around us, we wouldn't take too much time before it would be too late to
    help civilizations on the brink of extinction. The assumption was made that the lower bound for this period was 300
    years and the upper bound was 1,000 years. Thus 700 years from now was picked as the "middle of the road" timeframe
    that would be acceptable to both (expecting only one arrival at a time, with the second coming later) parties.
</p>
<h3>Inspiration and logic</h3>
<p>
    The timeframe was specified largely on the inspiration of an incoming dream and subsequent ideas and the need to
    help others survive. However, it also makes sense on a purely logical level - as soon as a civilization with nearby
    vacant lots is capable of existing with other civilization(s) in the same star system it will be asked to do so,
    simply because there is always a civilization in need due to constantly on-going stellar events that threaten its
    existence.
</p>
<h2>The aquatics</h2>
<p>
    The expected existence of (possibly technologically) intelligent species within the Solar System factored in as
    something that needs to be addressed before the introduction of "other children from burnt-out houses". Thus the
    timeframe of 70-700 years from now was introduced, with the necessary preparations for it coming in at 0-70 years.
</p>
<p>
    Logically, introducing aquatic (and thus non-territorially conflicting) species to Earth would prepare us for
    co-habitation of the Solar System "house". The external (to our Solar System) civilizations would be dry
    surface-based but would be safely separated from us by being on other planets. The aquatics to be introduced to our
    own oceans would co-habit the planet ("room") with us. However, they are not to inhabit the continents,
    thus preventing the predicted fight to extermination between dry surface-based intelligent species.
</p>
<p>
    MTABS argues that there are (near and, as added in the notes, at least in the case of Pluto fully) technologically
    intelligent aquatics. From that, the logic follows that the morally right thing to do is to "show them God's Light"
    and give them a chance to eventually develop space-faring civilizations. The argument also assumes that the gains
    would be mutual and that the Earth would gain custodians of the oceans that would protect them from overuse and
    mismanagement. On top of that, working with the less technologically advanced aquatics before the arrival of more
    technologically advanced "housemates" would ease us into the coming conditions.
</p>
<p>
    MTABS logic assumes that we have several (potentially) technologically intelligent aquatic species in oceans of
    various moons/dwarf planets. This implies that some of them will be more advanced and thus more territorially
    aggressive (or just plain old more aggressive). The logical assumption then is to first populate less advanced
    aquatics and more peaceful aquatics to ensure that they will have a place in the (what is assumed to necessarily be)
    balance of forces in the extraterrestrially populated parts of the oceans.
</p>
<h2>The progression Ages</h2>
<p>
    As is apparent now, the general progression is split up into 3 Ages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Earth - Phases: 1-5</li>
    <li>Solar System - Phases: 3-6</li>
    <li>Sun - Phases: 5 - 7</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Subsequently the progression involves more than just the species of our Solar System (native and introduced at
planetarily discrete level where there are no intelligent species or potential dry sub-surface intelligent species need
help to progress forward - on a hunch from a dream of an intelligent sub-surface existence) and merges into the overall
regional and (Sub)-Galactic progressions.

<h2>What the model is not</h2>
<p>
    It is important to note that MTABS theory is generally bound in dimension, space and time. It does not deal with
    multi-dimensional multi-verses, or parallel Earths in our dimension (alike or purposeful), or the polka dot universe
    theory, even though its imagery may be <a
        href="../../../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#polka-dot-awareness">referenced</a> (likely with divine inspiration).
    In terms of space, in its farthest abstract reaches, it does not go past joining the collective contributions to
    gravitational security of our galaxy relative to the local gravitational center. As a long term, though unsure goal
    it deals with the possible collision with Andromeda. Realistically, it reaches only to early-stage contribution to
    intra-Galactic safety.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of time it only briefly mentions the eternal Sun, very hypothetically mentioning lifespan extendability to
    a trillion years. It does not at all touch the theoretical cycle of universes (scarily finite or indefinitely
    extended based on continuous improvement). At an abstract level, it doesn't extend out past single digits of
    billions of years in possible Galaxy-cooperative (as a one of large multitude) future contributions positioning of
    our Galaxy with respect to the local gravitational center. More concretely the model is bound to the
    humanity-specific, hour-glass like development story, with a likely necessary mentioned transition to a much longer
    period of service of the greater galactic community.
</p>
<p>
    The now understood, though <a href="../../../2022/Finding_rocks.html">initially specified</a>, bounds of MTABS deal
    with making safe and eventually collaboratively securing the Earth, the Solar System and the Sun and by extension
    eventual, appropriate and collaborative contribution to these efforts while in service of others. Its backward
    modeling starts at (or really not far back of it, at arrival of primates) the extinction event which led to the
    eventual rise of the Human Race. Thus, following the symmetry of the model it does not attempt to approximate the
    related development vector past 70 million years into the future. At that time the breadth of possible outcomes is
    very vast and the safety and security dynamics in our regional, or even sub-galactic level may change, possibly even
    drastically. We are also assumed to have gone through a "pre-leading" direct (though not interfering, minor and
    responsible party level) involvement in co-raising (to spacefaring capabilities and beyond) up to a few other
    species (assuming ?beyond our star system?) and the subsequent "proto-leading" indirect involvement (one level above
    direct involvement).

    The Second Age consists of with Phase 3 (population of additional aquatics, initial population of Venus and Mars),
    Phase
    4 (taking care of the Solar System, in a collective fashion), Phase 5 (utilizing the resources of the Solar System
    to grow our combined industrial capacities and technological abilities) and Phase 6 (setting up Solar System
    infrastructure and ensuring safety of the Solar System's populated planets and their biospheres).
</p>
<p>
    The Third Age consists of Phase 5 (early Sun management), Phase 6 (initial management of Sun's
    surface) and Phase 7 (extracting heavier elements from the Sun's core, finally achieving its eternity and the
    associated eternity of the Solar System and Earth).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Updated: 11/25/2024</b> As is now apparent, before ensuring safety of the Sun we must first be safe ourselves.
    From that the additional societal progression has emerged. It deals with the threat of violence and eventually no
    violence. Per the MTABS model, the final arrival at a dry-surface-planetary society without (non-accidental and
    non-wildlife interacting, though by then <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_from_the_Future">myelophones</a> might exist) violence is expected to
    happen at the end of Phase 5 (~700,000 years from now) and roughly aligns with our existing progression backwards in
    time, from a Proto-Human Physical State to a <a
        href="https://www.may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/notes/2024_06_14_3-Level_of_integration.html#No_Threat_of_Violence_progression">Human
        Physical State</a>. The associated mental and spiritual progressions also deal with the societal problem of
    violence. To keep us from completely "going soft" the safety (and eventually security) concerns are externalized
    into space. Non-long-term-occupational (anything beyond an acute occurrence), increasingly more widely and
    inclusively collaborative NLNM across planets and eventually across Star Systems may also be a viable option to
    "keep us going". Really whatever works to ensure our continous two-gender, family oriented existence. &#x262F; Given
    the contemporary (perhaps naturally occuring at the neck of the timescale progression) societal (d)evolutionary
    steps we must believe that with God's help we will (as a general, non-totalitarian but ever-improving rule) keep on
    progressing in a balanced and wholly way. &#128591;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Updated: 11/26/2024</b> Moreover, we should not forget about security and understand that men are needed for
    taking on physically hard tasks where speaking the truth and doing the right thing is part of the job description.
    And afterall, men that served (in large numbers and in NLNM functions) would fulfill a long-present critical duty,
    be fulfilled themselves and be the ones that would secure our evolution to the non-violent ways in everyday life.
