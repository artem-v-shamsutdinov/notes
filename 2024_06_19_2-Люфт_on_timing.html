With the assumption of the eventual integration ideally happening at the level of <a
    href="./2024_06_19_2-Люфт_on_timing.html">No Threat of Violence</a>, seconded by the more immediate need for it (in
the scenario of <a href="./2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">aquatic integration</a>) Orbital Feel should most likely be
the entity that will lead the social transition to it. Given the technological developments and the
post-financial-globalism region enlargement, the natural progression to (regional) NTV will happen (in the most advanced
parts of the world) by the end of the century (if not sooner). Thus it makes sense for the creation of Orbital Fleet to
happen within a couple of generations.

This gives the flexibility to delay the events of publically proving the existence of extraterrestrial life and orbital
adjustments of asteroids, until the most opportune moment, to achieve the optimal conditions for future growth and
common benefit of all parties (on all foreseeable levels - <a

Given the near-solar show of force in early 2023 and the generated global societal momentum, it makes sense to utilize
this energy in certain appropriate steps closer to the present time. Additional thought needs to be put in on what exact
steps these should be. Certainly, the possibility of social (planet-wide) unrest needs to be taken into account to
maximize AWU.

Or (given the current tendencies to shorter-term thinking) we could just wing it (as usual I assume) and let the heavens
decide when and how ...
