Had another relevant extra-Solar System <a
    href="./thoughts_of_the_future/the_three_planets/The_refugees_and_the_Sun.html#dreams">dream</a>, or a possible
?another? preventable version of our own future, given homo sapiens depictions (indeterminable in the other not <a

    realistic</a> ?extra-Solar System <a
    href="./thoughts_of_the_future/our_way/If_you_hurry_you_make_people_laugh.html#NLNM_beyond_Earth">dream</a>?, beyond
the upright, common to us appearances), in which case it is the (to be) well understood regional/habitat/nation limited
forewarning simulation. Either way, two is enough, thank you, please. :)
<br>
<br>
1. A depiction of a ?social? advertisement of elites promoting brute mechanical strength in propulsion.
<br>
<br>
2. Several scenes of brutal (at times mutilating) existence in the ?literally? lower levels of society - a literal
aggressively violent struggle for survival, without any signs of civil discipline.
<br>
<br>
<br>
With that in mind, and to prevent any canonization of the ideas, information and the time progression hypothesis
presented in this blog that are meant to be argued against (as almost nothing in here rhymes) and evolved over time,
here is a digest:
<br>
<br>
<b>Added: 3/3/2025</b>
<br>
<br>
i. The most important information stated here is that we are to continue our existence for eons to come (well beyond
Phase 1). We have deep evolutionary roots and have the right to continue to exist.
<br>
<br>
ii. Our evolutionary roots are tied to our planet - Earth, and our star - Sun and we should continue the privilege of
having our planet and our star that our planet rotates around. With the scope of our involvement growing through and
beyond Age One we also need to help collectively maintain our beautiful Solar System.
<br>
<br>
iii. We are fast approaching the very significant milestone of attaining nuclear fusion energy.
<br>
<br>
iv. Adding any additional information to the digest beyond that would (as Edna would say it) <a
    href="https://youtu.be/cBttui3z2ME?si=iGk7Y5ZTqPoRcA8y">distract from the now</a>.
<br>
<br>
<b>(Added: 3/4/2025)</b> NOTE: To increase the chances of our long term survival and thriving we (with God's help and
divine guidance) need to maintain (at the very least through Age One) ideological, governance and economic approach
diversity. Maintaining and developing our existing cultures and civilizational approaches will best serve our own
interests. What may seem like a backwards or an out of touch approach now may greatly contribute to our survival at some
point in the future that we are not yet aware of.
<br>
<br>
<b>(Added: 3/4/2025)</b> NOTE: A healthy continuous and dynamic balance of competition versus cooperation across and
within all ideological, governance (national, international and above) and economic levels and in a multitude of forms
will continue to propel us forward. Non-lethal, non-mutilating, not seriously injuring hostilities (realistic or
ritualized) may help us maintain healthy relations in and across our societies, foster civil discipline and prevent
uncontrollable negative events, possibly through Age One.

Well, now is the time to honor my agreement and not produce any more related content (short of fixing existing errors)
until I've read and wised up enough (some 48+ years from now :) .

<h2>A Phase 4 ?hint?</h2>

<b>Added: 4/5/2025</b>
<br>
<br>
A thought came last night:
<br>
<br>
Based on the <a href="https://x.com/Helion_Energy">pace</a> of <a href="https://x.com/CFS_energy">progress</a> it is
possible to speculate that net engineering energy gain from nuclear fusion energy will arrive in 2026. This gives an
interesting numeric combination if the 7 * 10^N is correct (with N being the MTABS Phase number). End of Phase 1 would
fall on 2096, Phase 2 on 2796 and Phase 3 on 9796. A further assumption of a by-century countdown leads us to 9796 +
9600 = 19396. What could possibly await humanity in the middle of the 20th millennia that could be predictably
derived to warrant a countdown?
<br>
<br>
To stay within the MTABS model, 20th millennium is the beginning Phase 4 - The Big Dish, which is most concisely
described as "Clean up the playground. Asteroid safety, initial venturing into the neighborhood." Phase 4 is also
described as on Mom's "The Summer" parental leave.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the answer may be understood 48 and a half years from now, when the domestic environment may be quite different
(at least in some families and in some parts of the world). After arriving from the hospital and acclimating at home
some of the responsibilities of daily care for the baby may be delegated to robotic helper(s). And how that would look
like and what challenges will be there will only be truly understood when we arrive in that age. Or maybe it's simply
that some babies may already be taken on walks outside of the home and may get exposure to a wider range of climate
conditions, new smells and sounds. Or maybe it's just that at that age babies start noticing light and dark shapes and
might become drawn to bright colors and big shapes. Or perhaps it's a combination of all three. Certainly the choices
we'll be making in decades, centuries and millennia to come will affect the impact of whatever is to come. And where
we'll end up in half a century could give some hints into what such a countdown could be suggesting ... :)
