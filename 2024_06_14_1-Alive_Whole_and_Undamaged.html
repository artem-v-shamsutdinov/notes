With the assumption made in the <a href="./2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">previous note</a>, within 100 years we will
become the emerging custodians of several races of intelligent beings, native to our Solar System. As our technological
capabilities increase (drastically reducing in-system travel times and increasing payload capacity) we will come into
more regular and tight contact with the most advanced of them (potentially gradually introducing them in some of the
Earth's oceans). In our dealings with these intelligent beings, we must avoid deadly and maiming conflict and ensure
(to the best of our capability) that all intelligent beings have <a href="https://past-the-war.earth">the right to
    be</a>:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Alive,</b></li>
    <li><b>Whole (not mutilated),</b></li>
    <li><b>Undamaged (not seriously damaged),</b></li>
    <li>Healthy</li>
</ul>
And the right to live:
<ul>
    <li>Long and</li>
    <li>Happily</li>
</ul>
Avoiding conflict with the co-located intelligent species will set the correct precedent for ourselves and extra-solar
space-faring races. It is the morally correct thing to do and also extremely beneficial for the human race, its
survival, and its independence.
<br>
<br>
We must remember that in our solar system, two additional dry-surface planets are theoretically capable of hosting life
and will eventually (likely with external help) be utilized. Thus we will likely be in the same system as other
space-faring races and must be prepared to take the best course of action for everyone by instilling the God-given
truths in our society and culture.
