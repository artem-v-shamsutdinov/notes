With the assumption made in the <a href="./2024_06_06_1-System_First.html">previous note</a>, within 100 years we will
realize that we are guardians of several species of intelligent beings, native to our Solar System. As our technological
capabilities increase (drastically reducing in-Solar System travel times and increasing payload capacity) we will come
into more regular and tight contact with the most advanced of them, potentially showing them God's light by (gradually)
introducing them to Earth's oceans, starting with well controlled regions and expanding (with proven <a
    href="./thoughts_of_the_future/timescale_progression/MTABS_Timescale_Progression.html#aquatic_guardians">symbiotic
    existence</a>) to let them eventually <a
    href="../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#Gods_light_and_space_faring_to_aquatics">develop their own space faring
    capabilities</a>. In our dealings with these intelligent beings, we must avoid deadly, mutilating or seriously
damaging conflict and ensure that all intelligent beings have <a href="https://past-the-war.earth">the right to be</a>:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Alive,</b></li>
    <li><b>Whole (not mutilated),</b></li>
    <li><b>Undamaged (not seriously damaged),</b></li>
    <li>Healthy</li>
</ul>
And the right to live:
<ul>
    <li>Long</li>
    <li>Happily</li>
    <li>Kindly</li>
</ul>
Avoiding conflict with the Solar System co-located (and potentially co-located aquatically, on Earth) intelligent
species will set the correct precedent for ourselves and <a
    href="./thoughts_of_the_future/the_three_planets/The_refugees_and_the_Sun.html">extra-solar space-faring
    species</a>. It is the morally correct thing to do and also extremely beneficial for the human species, our
survival, and our independence.
<br>
<br>
We must remember that in our solar system, two additional dry-surface planets are theoretically capable of
(and both may already be) hosting life and will eventually (likely with external help) be populated on their surfaces.
Thus we will likely be in the same system as other space-faring species and must be prepared to take the best course of
action for everyone by instilling the God-given truths in our society and culture.
