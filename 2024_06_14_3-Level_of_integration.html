<b>Last Update: 1/17/2025</b>
<h2>The state of things on Earth</h2>
We now have a model of the levels of development humanity went through:
<p>
    <b>1. Total Violence</b> - I will kill you (and take your means of production).
</p>
<p>
    This is the natural state of things in nature - the Tribal system. Our Tribal system was of course more developed
    and more diverse but at the model level, this is it. Two groups of people met and the chance of total violence was
    determined by their level of familiarity and ability to communicate and find a compromise.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for tens of millions of years (at least, and is still there for non-humans). It is still
    interwoven into our lives in many societies (along with more advanced forms of existence).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    For the largest part of this period, humanity and its predecessors were in a physical animal state. In the later
    stages (arguably between 3 million and up to ~200,000 years ago) humanity was in a physical semi-animal state.
    Subsequently, anatomically modern humans evolved but our thinking remained deeply tied to nature, and the thinking
    was still stuck mostly in a naturalistic/animalistic frame of reference (event as we now know at least to the time
    of GÃ¶bekli Tepe), lasting to at least 10,000 years ago. Naturalistic and animalistic cultural elements and
    thinking/ideology are still present everywhere in the world but are much more pronounced in regions like Africa,
    North American reservations (and presumably in other parts of the Americas), and the Eurasian Northeast. Per the
    MTABS model this lasted from ~700,000 to ~700 BCE (and was augmented with later stages at ~70,000 and ~7,000 BCE).
</p>
<p>
    <br>
<p>
    <b>2. Systemized Violence</b> - I will own you (and use you as a means of production).
</p>
<p>
    Of course, we know that there were slave warriors and even slave armies but for the sake of the model, the idea is
    that Slavery deprived individuals of their rights, forced them to work, but kept them alive in exchange (if they
    obediently followed orders).
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (arguably tens of) thousands of years and was only finally officially dismantled in the 20th
    century. It is still unofficially present in at least some parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Human slavery on our planet is traceable to 11,000 years ago (at least). During this period the mental matrix of the
    society was keeping the (increasingly larger portions of the) population in a semi-animal state, where they were
    owned by either a government or private parties. Per the MTABS model, this period lasted from ~70,000 years ago to
    (arguably and with variations between regions) ~70 years ago, with regional variation of late 19th to mid 20th century,
    at the end of the institutionalized practice of slavery in the USA, serfdom Russian Empire and until unyielding, total
    enforcement of no slavery in China by CCP, where Slavery and Feudalism overlapped for thousands of years.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>3. Open Threat of Violence</b> - I will kill you if (you don't give me your means of production).
</p>
<p>
    For most of the people in it, Feudalism meant working someone else's land and keeping the excess that wasn't taken
    away from you (while also not being able to leave the land you worked). For the sake of the model, this also meant
    that you didn't have to fight when the wars were fought (leaving that to the free men) freeing you from the high
    chance of premature death, as long as you followed the rules imposed on you.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (a) thousand(s) years (depending on where in the world you were). Quite a bit of the World
    unofficially continues to live by the rule of the open threat of violence, even if the economic system is no longer
    tied to the land.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Feudalism has been in our society starting probably 7,000 years ago (since we've been growing crops and protecting
    the land on which we grew them, especially in the more civilized regions,
    likely evolved with some level of external help). The mentality of Feudalism is more clearly human but spiritually
    tying humans to territory kept them in a Semi-Animal Mental and even more so Spiritual state. In Europe, this was clearly defined with
    pre-reform Christianity and its nomenclature. This shift political fragmentation and overarching spiritual control marks the references to this
    (regionally widely differing) period.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>4. Hidden Threat of Violence</b> - I will fire you if (whatever).
</p>
<p>
    Much of the world is now living in some version of the system (often interwoven with the previous systems). This is
    an unnatural stage as the presence of violence takes a hard-to-determine but repulsive form that demotivates people
    - most people (still) don't like their jobs (and the environments they work in). But much more importantly there is
    no more systematic "I will kill you if". But at least in some parts of the world workplaces are progressing to
    motivate people by how they change the world for the better and not by "I will fire you if".
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for hundreds of years in some parts of the world and was largely skipped by most of the world (at
    least in its pure form) which had a higher proportion of tribal and feudal elements.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Focus away from land-based wealth to capital-based wealth is logically the final step of mental externalization of
    means of production away from humans (just as Fedualism presumably was on the physical level). Due to the
    (gradually reducing) focus on capital building and not (yet) on the (gradually increasing, with some spiraling
    perturbations and regional variations) welfare of the members of society, the system is keeping us in a spiritual
    semi-animal state. The time period (per MTABS model) is roughly from 700 years ago to the present.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>5. No Threat of Violence</b> - We hope you join us because ...
</p>
<p>
    We are now on the verge of this stage, to be brought about by nuclear fusion and robotization, which will increase
    productivity (eventually by an order of magnitude and more). People will 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Axe1dLcxgUU?si=OYGtBsoYwa25F4Im">still work</a> of course, but they won't
    (eventually) do so to make a basic living but instead will do so to help people around them (and the greater world).
</p>
<p>
    Based on the assumption that the trend inverts (like an hourglass) this stage will last for (a) thousand(s of)
    years.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Updates 6/22, 1/17/2025</b>
    Having lived in an anti-capitalist society that attempted to build the heavens-rebellious state of juvenile
    Communism, with Socialist designs (Soviet democracy) but lacking implementation due to heavy Feudal influence
    and the associated imperial thinking (in partial defense, it be said that it was forced on the society at
    least to preserve its statehood against foreign aggression, which was also the cause of excessive centralization) I know what it felt like not to be seen a "dollar
    sign". Thus, it can be abstracted away that starting with the upcoming early version of "Social"ism/"Human"ism we
    will finally start to achieve the spiritual human state, thus completing the triad of physical, mental, and
    spiritual humanhood. Likely the following advancements will deal with us helping other intelligent species achieve the same.
    Eventually these advancements will help all of the inhabitants greater Solar System achieve inter-planetary No Threat of Violence.
    Per MTABS model this period began to manifest itself after the end of Systemized Violence (with post WWII global social changes)
    and will last on Earth until ~70,000 years from now (when we conclude dry-surface inter-governmental violent conflict on Earth).
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>6. No Violence</b> - No one will kill you or hurt you (in any way, guaranteed, no matter who you are or where you
    are).  This is of course within the bounds of dry surface of our planet, which by then will no longer be politically divided.
</p>
<p>
    This is the state we've all been dreaming of for a very long time but we have a long way to go before we can truly
    get there.
</p>
<p>
    By the hourglass principle, per the MTABS model this stage will last from Phase 5 (~70,000 years from now) and through Phase 7
    and possibly beyond.  Though by that time it will likely be largely up to us to directly (but with respect for time) evolve the
    course of events and determine the vector of the advancement of our biological progress.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>7. Unknown</b>
</p>
<p>
    It can only be speculated that beyond violence humanity will be faced with the ultimate question of mortals - Death.
    Thus a similar (in Mental and Physical plains) progression can be built for phases <a
        href="possible-direction-of-progression">8 and beyond</a>. In either case,
    as far as we know Mohammad was the only person to walk in and out of heaven ...

<h2>Update 8/23/2024 - Hypotheses tie in</h2>
<!--
<s>Wrong Logic (below) on a base assumption: have to solve violence before being able to work on Death in general
With the "Humanity Development" hypothesis identified the rough tie in of the State of Being hypothesis the "No Thread
of Violence" level in Phase 2 of the "Humanity Development" hypothesis. And, hoping for God's permission, the entry
intro
Mental and Physical immortality State of Being progression (with Mental achievements leading ahead of physical), would
begin in Phase 3 at "Localized No Violence" (flipped from Total Violence entry into the Threat of Violence side),
followed by "Sporatic No Violence" mapping to Phase 4 and Non-Guaranteed No Violence, Partial No Violence and And Full
No Violence for Phases 5, 6 and 7.  This also maps to to achieving virtual immortality for the Sun (1 trillion years)
by the end of Phase 7.</>

<b>Update 9/30/2024</b> NOTE:
<br>
MTABS progression equates the (open ended with possible eventual transition) lifespan of humanity to a human lifespan
and assumes that humanity will be able to materially enable (co-lead) the progression of an upcoming technologically
intelligent race, through its evolutionary steps. Thus the general assumption of a ???~25M - ~75M??? span of time for a
??two-stage?? mature involvement (?with prior assisting experience?). With that, and the assumption of a 30 year
lifespan for the led species, lifespans beyond 700 (a la 7000 years) appear to be inappropriate due to inability to
relate to and understand the led species and be Earth-bound (5 year old child vs 6 month old baby). To be on the safe
side the above matrix keeps the estimate low.
<br>
<br>
<b>Update 9/23/2024</b> NOTE:
<br>
Per the original MTABS progression, increases past the average ~100-year lifespan could be granted
to us for accomplishing good deeds, such as mass-introduction of potentially technologically intelligent aquatic
species into Earth's oceans (showing them God's light). Subsequent increases may be granted to us by further
goodwill deeds on Earth and acts of goodwill in the Solar System, such as supporting extrasolar races on the two
?vacant? inner rocky planets. Further increases may be enabled by pre and proto-leading of aquatics to the path of
building space-faring civilizations. Great increases in lifespan in <a
    href="../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html#the-service">Phase 8</a> and beyond may be unlocked by prior
pre-leading activities among the "adopted" aquatic races (Phase 7+) and with assumed success there, via subsequent
additional efforts (Phase 8+).
<br>
<br>
<b>Update 9/23/2024</b> NOTE:
<br>
Ultimately it is up to us to collectively decide the path we will be led on and eventually, the
path we will lead. We are now under divine guidance and MTABS progression suggests that will probably continue to
enjoy guidance for eons to come, through Phase 8 and possibly even beyond, until we gain the ultimate divine saving.
As has been known we are on a narrow path to the future. But that bridge may not have a fixed point of arrival. Our
(pre)history, genetics, geography, and the Solar (star and system) circumstances may set the general direction of
our future movements but the destination may vary widely based on the choices we collectively will be making.
</p>
<br>
<p id="possible-direction-of-progression">
    Given the near, fast approaching (possibly at the end of this year) symbolic hourglass neck event (and a la "Space
    Race"), it appears to be appropriate to hypothesize on the further direction of the above progression: Having
    ensured the survival of our God-given star and thus our own survival as a species, we may be enabled to
    properly (via natural means) start solving the Eternal-Human question.
</p>
<p>
    By extension, the assumed to be accompanying No Violence stages (at the intra-dominant species, inter-dominant
    species, 'Mankind'-to-animal, 'Mankind'-to-organism levels) at (progressively) Planetary, ?Solar System?, and beyond
    levels may not be <u>naturally enforcable</u> until the Transitional status of the dominant species in question.
    Though this assumption may vary galagraphically and with the progression of time of entry into the Transitional
    phases.

<b>Last Update: 1/17/2025</b>
<h2>Update 6/22/2024: Fire of different colors</h2>
<p>
    More abstractly projecting ahead:
    <br>
    <br>
    In accordance with the <a href="../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html">MTABS model</a>, the following 3 phases will see the
    transition to "No inter-neighbor-nation Threat of Violence"  (starting at the upcoming time of achieving nuclear 
    fusion, finally achieving its complete assurance ~7,000 years from then), subsequent establishment of No Threat of 
    Violence on Earth (starting with the establishement of NLNM combat, ~70 years from the
    start of fusion energy, finally achieving ~70,000 from then). However, the flavors of the advancement will differ,
    based on the region.
</p>
<p>
    Each region will have a dominating group of themes, which will provide increasingly merging away flavor (in terms of
    the Threat of Violence). <b>Update: 6/23/2024</b> These may be (experts - help needed, please):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Africa: (externally divide-and-conquer encouraged 1), (conflict-forced 2) (and localized 3).  Hopefuly
        <a href="https://past-the-war-earth.pages.dev/2025/The_importance_of_transitional_zones">rapidly progressing</a>
        to 5.
    </li>
    <li>
        Middle East: 2-4 (with a possible, alike rapid progression to 5 with reduction of external infuence and estabishment
        of stable internal balance of forces and associated security cooperation).
    </li>
    <li>
        Europe (greatly influenced by recent influxes of migrants and the end of expansionism): 3-5
    </li>
    <li>
        Northern Eurasia, with "transitional zones" at the naturally defensible boundaries and (a personal hope) gradually
        restoring the friendship of the people of all former Soviet republics: 3 & 5
    </li>
    <li>
        North America: having no existential security threats (and rapidly moving away from 2) & likely necessary
        continuation of 4 (likely at least until ~700 from fusion) for rapid solution of climatic and tectonic questions.
        Early (if not the earliest) but very gradual addition of 5.
    </li>
    <li>
        South and East Asia were likely heavily influenced by external forces and contain their own mixes but South Asia
        is heavy on 4 and East Asia is heavy on 3. South East Asia is a more localized mixture of the above two and
        Australia (and part of Oceania is likely a 1 & 5 (and probably 4) distillation of externally and internally
        derived factors.
    </li>
    <li>
        South America (?itself is possibly a 1 & 5 dominated combination?) may be the most externally threatened region
        and is probably best grouped with South East Asia, providing mixed external cover.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Update 6/22/2024: Keeping the Seas and their Fire</h2>
<p>
    Looking even more abstractly, starting with Phase 2, the targeted addition of tribal aquatic culture(s) makes sense
    in (at least to begin with) <a href="https://past-the-war.earth/notes/future_projections-in_A_Better_World/Nobile_goal_behind_the_Safety_in_South_China_Sea">
        controlled regions</a> around the Indian Ocean, given South Asia's (likely most pronounced) <a
        href="https://past-the-war.earth/2024/history/India.html#the_beginnings">external influence</a> and its flavor
    of 4. This is aided by the 3 African flavor and the mixed Southeast Asian flavor (and the Australian derivative).
</p>
<p>
    Looking into Phase 3 (with earlier acceleration experiments), the Pacific Ocean appears to be a good candidate for
    the partial migration of the industrially developed aquatic species. It is possible that here we will need for the
    (likely developed with <a href="https://past-the-war.earth/2024/history/China.html#the_beginnings">external aid</a>)
    3 focus of East Asia added to the perimeter, given the higher risks of escalation of territorial hostilities based
    on ideological differences.  Sea of Japan appears to be the best place to start, with a likely controlled expansion
    to the Sea of Okhotsk.
</p>
<h2>
    The state of things in the Cosmos
</h2>
<p>
    Of course, we don't know how things are on the Cosmic level. The answer probably is - it depends. Probably
    intelligent species/planets are given a choice of how to exist in the space around them and can probably interact with other
    species/planets on any of the levels described above.
</p>
<p>
    Thus the question becomes - when we do Integrate at what level will we do so? If we try to integrate into a higher
    level, will we be able to keep our independence or even our species/planetary identity?
</p>
<br>
<b>Update: 6/24/2024</b>
<h2>We are all people, we are all persons</h2>
<p>
    As I'm writing this deadly atrocities are being committed against people in Sudan and Gaza, against everyone,
    including children. Starvation and disease are spreading because of war, caused by a small groups of elites fighting
    for influence. And the atrocities are also being committed outside of these conflict zones. Now as always, we must
    remember that human life is above all price. Everyone, no matter their ethnicity or nationality deserves the right
    to be Alive, Whole, and Undamaged. Killing or permanently (permanently) harming a human being is a sin before God
    and as humanity (and the heavens) progress(es) forward we will be held increasingly more accountable for committing
    it. Praying to God for granting these rights to everyone (who we are allowed to pray for) is not enough. We must do
    better and ensure that these rights are guaranteed for all human beings.
</p>
<p>
    Going forward, we must also do what we can to guarantee these rights to all intelligent beings. Whenever Orbital
    Fleet is established, it must at its core place the above values. Placing life (and the two naturally following
    priorities) as the most important thing needs to start from the very beginning and be instilled in its regulations
    and culture.
</p>
<p>
    All Orbital Fleet personnel must at all times maintain and enforce this culture. Starting with recruit training
    centers, the instructing personnel must treat the conscripts as human beings, even if they are argumentative, late,
    or slow. This must be done both formally and through proper attitude - no matter what motivational techniques are
    used.
