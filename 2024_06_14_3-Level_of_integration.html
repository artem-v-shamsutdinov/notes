<h1>Level of "Cosmic" Integration</h1>
<i>I sometimes wonder if one of the core goals of the Universe is solving the problem of violence, progressively on all
    levels.</i>
<h2>The state of things on Earth</h2>
We now have a model of the levels of development humanity went through:
<p>
    <b>1. Total Violence</b> - I will kill you (and take your factors of production).
</p>
<p>
    This is the natural state of things in nature - the Tribal system. Our Tribal system was of course more developed
    and more diverse but at the model level, this is it. Two groups of people met and the chance of total violence was
    determined by their level of familiarity and ability to communicate and find a compromise.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for tens of millions of years (at least, and is still there for non-humans). It is still
    interwoven into our lives in many societies (along with more advanced forms of existence).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    For the largest part of this period, humanity and its predecessors were in a physical animal state. In the later
    stages (arguably between 3 million and up to ~200,000 years ago) humanity was in a physical semi-animal state.
    Subsequently, anatomically modern humans evolved but our thinking remained deeply tied to nature, and the thinking
    was still stuck mostly in a naturalistic/animalistic frame of reference (event as we now know at least to the time
    of GÃ¶bekli Tepe), lasting to at least 10,000 years ago. Naturalistic and animalistic cultural elements and
    thinking/ideology are still present everywhere in the world but are much more pronounced in regions like Africa,
    North American reservations (and presumably in other parts of the Americas), and the Eurasian Northeast. The MTABS
    model symbol for the ~200,000 to ~10,000 BCE period is <b>Family</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
<p>
    <b>2. Systemized Violence</b> - I will own you (and use you as a factor of production).
</p>
<p>
    Of course, we know that there were slave warriors and even slave armies but for the sake of the model, the idea is
    that Slavery deprived individuals of their rights, forced them to work, but kept them alive in exchange (if they
    obediently followed orders).
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (arguably tens of) thousands of years and was only finally officially dismantled in the 20th
    century. It is still unofficially present in at least some parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Human slavery on our planet is traceable to 11,000 years ago (at least). During this period the mental matrix of the
    society was keeping the (increasingly larger portions of the) population in a semi-animal state, where they were
    owned by either a government or private parties. The MTABS model symbol for this period of ~10,000 to (arguably and
    with variations between regions) ~2,000 years ago is <b>Territory</b>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>3. Open Threat of Violence</b> - I will kill you if (you don't give me your factors of production).
</p>
<p>
    For most of the people in it, Feudalism meant working someone else's land and keeping the excess that wasn't taken
    away from you (while also not being able to leave the land you worked). For the sake of the model, this also meant
    that you didn't have to fight when the wars were fought (leaving that to the free men) freeing you from the high
    chance of premature death, as long as you followed the rules imposed on you.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (a) thousand(s) years (depending on where in the world you were). Quite a bit of the World
    unofficially continues to live by the rule of the open threat of violence, even if the economic system is no longer
    tied to the land.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Feudalism has been in our society starting probably 3,000 years ago (especially in the more civilized regions,
    likely evolved with some level of external help). The mentality of feudalism is more clearly human but spiritually
    tying humans to territory kept them in a spiritually animal state. In Europe, this was clearly defined with
    pre-reform Christianity and its nomenclature. This shift to spiritual control marks the references to this
    (regionally wide differing) period in the MTABS model with the symbol of the <b>Heavens</b>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>4. Vailed Threat of Violence</b> - I will fire you if (whatever).
</p>
<p>
    Much of the world is now living in some version of the system (often interwoven with the previous systems). This is
    an unnatural stage as the presence of violence takes a hard-to-determine but repulsive form that demotivates people
    - most people (still) don't like their jobs (and the environments they work in). But much more importantly there is
    no more systematic "I will kill you if". But at least in some parts of the world workplaces are progressing to
    motivate people by how they change the world for the better and not by "I will fire you if".
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for hundreds of years in some parts of the world and was largely skipped by most of the world (at
    least in its pure form) which had a higher proportion of tribal and feudal elements.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Focus away from land-based wealth to capital-based wealth is logically the final step of mental externalization of
    factors of production away from humans (just as Fedualism presumably was on the physical level). Due to the
    (gradually reducing) focus on capital building and not (yet) on the (gradually increasing, with some spiraling
    perturbations and regional variations) welfare of the members of society, the system is keeping us in a spiritual
    semi-animal state. The MTABS model for this period of roughly 500 years ago to the present is the trade essential
    <b>Seas</b>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>5. No Threat of Violence</b> - We hope you join us because ...
</p>
<p>
    We are now on the verge of this stage, to be brought about by nuclear fusion and robotization, which will increase
    productivity (eventually by an order of magnitude and more). People will still work of course, but they won't
    (eventually) do so to make a basic living but to help people around them (and the greater world).
</p>
<p>
    Based on the assumption that the trend inverts (like an hourglass) this stage will last for (a) thousand(s of)
    years.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Update 6/22</b>
    Having lived in an anti-capitalist society that attempted to build the heavens-rebellious state of juvenile
    Communism, with Socialist designs (Soviet democracy) but lacking implementation due to heavy Feudal influence
    feudalism and the associated imperial thinking (in partial defense, it be said that it was forced on the society at
    least to preserve its statehood against foreign aggression) I know what it felt like not to be seen a "dollar
    sign". Thus, it can be abstracted away that starting with the upcoming early version of "Social"ism/"Human"ism we
    will finally start to achieve the spiritual human state, thus completing the triad of physical, mental, and
    spiritual humanhood. Likely the following advancements will deal with us helping others achieve the same and
    eventually help the greater society achieve lower levels of interstellar violence (thus completing the natural to us
    quintet). The MTABS model for this upcoming period of likely 1,000 to 10,000 years is the ?nuclear fusion related?
    <b>Fire</b>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>6. No Violence</b> - No one will kill you or hurt you (in any way, guaranteed, no matter who you are or where you
    are).
</p>
<p>
    This is the state we've all been dreaming of for a very long time but we have a long way to go before we can truly
    get there.
</p>
<p>
    By the hourglass principle, this stage will last for (?at least?) tens of millions of years.
</p>

<h2>Update 6/22/2024: Fire of different colors</h2>
<p>
    More abstractly projecting ahead:
    <br>
    <br>
    In accordance with the <a href="../2023/It_aint_the_crown.html">MTABS model</a>, the following 3 phases will see the
    transition to "No Threat of Violence" (0-100), an establishment of NTV in leading regions (50-1,000), and a much
    slower transition to it for the entire planet (500 - 10,000). However, the flavors of the advancement will differ,
    based on the region.
</p>
<p>
    Each region will have a dominating group of themes, which will provide increasingly merging away flavor (in terms of
    the threat of violence). <b>Update: 6/23/2024</b> These may be (experts - help needed, please):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Africa: 1, (partially externally forced in 2) (and localized 3)
    </li>
    <li>
        Middle East: 2-3
    </li>
    <li>
        Europe (greatly influenced) - 3-5
    </li>
    <li>
        Eurasia: 3 & 5
    </li>
    <li>
        North America: (rapidly moving away 2) & 4 (and probably slowly to be added 5)
    </li>
    <li>
        South and East Asia were likely heavily influenced by external forces and contain their own mixes but South Asia
        is heavy on 4 and East Asia is heavy on 3. South East Asia is a more localized mixture of the above 2 and
        Australia (and part of Oceania is likely a 1 & 5 (and probably 4) distillation of externally and internally
        derived factors.
    </li>
    <li>
        South America (?itself is possibly a 1 & 5 dominated combination?) may be the most externally threatened region
        and is probably best grouped with South East Asia, providing mixed external cover.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Update 6/22/2024: Keeping the Seas and their Fire</h2>
<p>
    Looking even more abstractly, starting with Phase 2, the addition of tribal aquatic culture(s) makes sense in the
    Indian Ocean, given South Asia's (likely most pronounced) <a
        href="https://past-the-war.earth/2024/history/India.html#the_beginnings">external influence</a> and its flavor
    of 4. This is aided by the 1-2 African flavor and the mixed Southeast Asian flavor (and the Australian derivative).
</p>
<p>
    Looking into Phase 3 (with earlier acceleration experiments), the Pacific Ocean appears to be a good candidate for
    the partial migration of the industrially developed aquatic species. It is possible that here we will need for the
    (likely developed with <a href="https://past-the-war.earth/2024/history/China.html#the_beginnings">external aid</a>)
    3 focus of East Asia added to the perimeter, given the higher risks of escalation of territorial hostilities based
    on ideological differences.
</p>
<h2>
    The state of things in the Cosmos
</h2>
<p>
    Of course, we don't know how things are on the Cosmic level. The answer probably is - it depends. Probably
    races/planets are given a choice of how to exist in the space around them and can probably interact with other
    races/planets on any of the levels described above.
</p>
<p>
    Thus the question becomes - when we do Integrate at what level will we do so? If we try to integrate into a higher
    level, will we be able to keep our independence or even our racial/planetary identity?
</p>
<br>
<b>Update: 6/24/2024</b>
<h2>We are all people, we are all persons</h2>
<p>
    As I'm writing this deadly atrocities are being committed against people in Sudan and Gaza, against everyone,
    including children. Starvation and disease are spreading because of war, caused by a small groups of elites fighting
    for influence. And the atrocities are also being committed outside of these conflict zones. Now as always, we must
    remember that human life is above all price. Everyone, no matter their ethnicity or nationality deserves the right
    to be Alive, Whole, and Undamaged. Killing or irreparably (permanently) harming a human being is a sin before God
    and as humanity (and the heavens) progress(es) forward we will be held increasingly more accountable for committing
    it. Praying to God for granting these rights to everyone (who we are allowed to pray for) is not enough. We must do
    better and ensure that these rights are guaranteed for all human beings.
</p>
<p>
    Going forward, we must also do what we can to guarantee these rights to all intelligent beings. Whenever Orbital
    Fleet is established, it must at its core place the above values. Placing life (and the two naturally following
    priorities) as the most important thing needs to start from the very beginning and be instilled in its regulations
    and culture.
</p>
<p>
    All Orbital Fleet personnel must at all times maintain and enforce this culture. Starting with recruit training
    centers, the instructing personnel must treat the conscripts as human beings, even if they are argumentative, late,
    or slow. This must be done both formally and through proper attitude - no matter what motivational techniques are
    used.
</p>
