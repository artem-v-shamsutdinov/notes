<h1>Level of "Cosmic" Integration</h1>
<i>I sometimes wonder if one of the core goals of the Universe is solving the problem of violence, progressively on all
    levels.</i>
<h2>The state of things on Earth</h2>
We now have a model of the levels of development humanity went through:
<p>
    <b>1. Total Violence</b> - I will kill you (and take your factors of production).
</p>
<p>
    This is the natural state of things in nature - the Tribal system. Our Tribal system was of course more developed
    and more diverse but at the model level, this is it. Two groups of people met and the chance of total violence was
    determined by their level of familiarity and ability to communicate and find a compromise.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for tens of millions of years (at least, and is still there for non-humans). It is still
    interwoven into our lives in many societies (along with more advanced forms of existence).
</p>
<p>
    <br>
<p>
    <b>2. Systemized Violence</b> - I will own you (and use you as a factor of production).
</p>
<p>
    Of course, we know that there were slave warriors and even slave armies but for the sake of the model, the idea is
    that Slavery deprived individuals of their rights, forced them to work, but kept them alive in exchange (if they
    obediently followed orders).
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (arguably tens of) thousands of years and was only finally officially dismantled in the 20th
    century. It is still unofficially present in at least some parts of the world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>3. Open threat of Violence</b> - I will kill you if (you don't give me your factors of production).
</p>
<p>
    For most of the people in it, Feudalism meant working someone else's land and keeping the excess that wasn't taken
    away from you (while also not being able to leave the land you worked). For the sake of the model, this also meant
    that you didn't have to fight when the wars were fought (leaving that to the free men) freeing you from the high
    chance of premature death, as long as you followed the rules imposed on you.
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for (a) thousand(s) years (depending on where in the world you were). Quite a bit of the World
    unofficially continues to live by the rule of the open threat of violence, even if the economic system is no longer
    tied to the land.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>4. Vailed threat of Violence</b> - I will fire you if (whatever).
</p>
<p>
    Much of the world is now living in some version of the system (often interwoven with the previous systems). This is
    an unnatural stage as the presence of violence takes a hard-to-determine but repulsive form that demotivates people
    - most people (still) don't like their jobs (and the environments they work in). But much more importantly there is
    no more systematic "I will kill you if". But at least in some parts of the world workplaces are progressing to
    motivate people by how they change the world for the better and not by "I will fire you if".
</p>
<p>
    This stage lasted for hundreds of years in some parts of the world and was largely skipped by most of the world (at
    least in its pure form) which had a higher proportion of tribal and feudal elements.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>5. No threat of Violence</b> - We hope you join us because ...
</p>
<p>
    We are now on the verge of this stage, to be brought about by nuclear fusion and robotization, which will increase
    productivity (eventually by an order of magnitude and more). People will still work of course, but they won't
    (eventually) do so to make a basic living but to help people around them (and the greater world).
</p>
<p>
    Based on the assumption that the trend inverts (like an hourglass) this stage will last for (a) thousand(s of)
    years.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>6. No Violence</b> - No one will kill you or hurt you (in any way, guaranteed, no matter who you are or where you
    are).
</p>
<p>
    This is the state we've all been dreaming of for a very long time but we have a long way to go before we can truly
    get there.
</p>
<p>
    By the hourglass principle, this stage will last for (?at least?) tens of millions of years.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <b>7. Unknown</b>
</p>
<p>
    As far as we know Mohammad was the only person to walk in and out of heaven ...
</p>
<h2>
    The state of things in the Cosmos
</h2>
<p>
    Of course, we don't know how things are on the Cosmic level. The answer probably is - it depends. Probably
    races/planets are given a choice of how to exist in the space around them and can probably interact with other
    races/planets on any of the levels described above.
</p>
<p>
    Thus the question becomes - when we do Integrate at what level will we do so? If we try to integrate into a higher
    level, will we be able to keep our independence or even our racial/planetary identity?
